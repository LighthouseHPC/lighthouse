*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CGELSY computes the minimum-norm solution to a complex linear least
*  squares problem:
*      minimize || A * X - B ||
*  using a complete orthogonal factorization of A.  A is an M-by-N
*  matrix which may be rank-deficient.
*
*  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*  M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
*  matrix X.
*
*  The routine first computes a QR factorization with column pivoting:
*      A * P = Q * [ R11 R12 ]
*                  [  0  R22 ]
*  with R11 defined as the largest leading submatrix whose estimated
*  condition number is less than 1/RCOND.  The order of R11, RANK,
*  is the effective rank of A.
*
*  Then, R22 is considered to be negligible, and R12 is annihilated
*  by unitary transformations from the right, arriving at the
*  complete orthogonal factorization:
*     A * P = Q * [ T11 0 ] * Z
*                 [  0  0 ]
*  The minimum-norm solution is then
*     X = P * Z' [ inv(T11)*Q1'*B ]
*                [        0       ]
*  where Q1 consists of the first RANK columns of Q.
*
*  This routine is basically identical to the original xGELSX except
*  three differences:
*    o The permutation of matrix B (the right hand side) is faster and
*      more simple.
*    o The call to the subroutine xGEQPF has been substituted by the
*      the call to the subroutine xGEQP3. This subroutine is a Blas-3
*      version of the QR factorization with column pivoting.
*    o Matrix B (the right hand side) is updated with Blas-3.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of
*          columns of matrices B and X. NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
*          On exit, A has been overwritten by details of its
*          complete orthogonal factorization.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  B       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,M,N).
*
*  JPVT    (input/output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, if JPVT(i) .ne. 0, the i-th column of A is permuted
*          to the front of AP, otherwise column i is a free column.
*          On exit, if JPVT(i) = k, then the i-th column of A*P
*          was the k-th column of A.
*
*  RCOND   (input) REAL
*          RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A, which
*          is defined as the order of the largest leading triangular
*          submatrix R11 in the QR factorization with pivoting of A,
*          whose estimated condition number < 1/RCOND.
*
*  RANK    (output) INTEGER
*          The effective rank of A, i.e., the order of the submatrix
*          R11.  This is the same as the order of the submatrix T11
*          in the complete orthogonal factorization of A.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.
*          The unblocked strategy requires that:
*            LWORK >= MN + MAX( 2*MN, N+1, MN+NRHS )
*          where MN = min(M,N).
*          The block algorithm requires that:
*            LWORK >= MN + MAX( 2*MN, NB*(N+1), MN+MN*NB, MN+NB*NRHS )
*          where NB is an upper bound on the blocksize returned
*          by ILAENV for the routines CGEQP3, CTZRZF, CTZRQF, CUNMQR,
*          and CUNMRZ.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
