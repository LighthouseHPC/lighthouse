*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSBEV computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of
*  a real symmetric band matrix A.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KD      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
*          or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB, N)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
*          matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
*          j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
*          as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
*
*          On exit, AB is overwritten by values generated during the
*          reduction to tridiagonal form.  If UPLO = 'U', the first
*          superdiagonal and the diagonal of the tridiagonal matrix T
*          are returned in rows KD and KD+1 of AB, and if UPLO = 'L',
*          the diagonal and first subdiagonal of T are returned in the
*          first two rows of AB.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD + 1.
*
*  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
*
*  Z       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, N)
*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the orthonormal
*          eigenvectors of the matrix A, with the i-th column of Z
*          holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (max(1,3*N-2))
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the algorithm failed to converge; i
*                off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal
*                form did not converge to zero.
