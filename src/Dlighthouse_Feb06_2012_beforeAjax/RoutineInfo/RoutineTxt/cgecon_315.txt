*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CGECON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a general
*  complex matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm, using
*  the LU factorization computed by CGETRF.
*
*  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
*  condition number is computed as
*     RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
*          infinity-norm condition number is required:
*          = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
*          = 'I':         Infinity-norm.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
*          as computed by CGETRF.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  ANORM   (input) REAL
*          If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A.
*          If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.
*
*  RCOND   (output) REAL
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
