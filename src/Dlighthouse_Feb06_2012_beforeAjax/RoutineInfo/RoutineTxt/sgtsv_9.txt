*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SGTSV  solves the equation
*
*     A*X = B,
*
*  where A is an n by n tridiagonal matrix, by Gaussian elimination with
*  partial pivoting.
*
*  Note that the equation  A**T*X = B  may be solved by interchanging the
*  order of the arguments DU and DL.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  DL      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, DL must contain the (n-1) sub-diagonal elements of
*          A.
*
*          On exit, DL is overwritten by the (n-2) elements of the
*          second super-diagonal of the upper triangular matrix U from
*          the LU factorization of A, in DL(1), ..., DL(n-2).
*
*  D       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, D must contain the diagonal elements of A.
*
*          On exit, D is overwritten by the n diagonal elements of U.
*
*  DU      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, DU must contain the (n-1) super-diagonal elements
*          of A.
*
*          On exit, DU is overwritten by the (n-1) elements of the first
*          super-diagonal of U.
*
*  B       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the N by NRHS matrix of right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the N by NRHS solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero, and the solution
*               has not been computed.  The factorization has not been
*               completed unless i = N.
