*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSYEVD computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
*  real symmetric matrix A. If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a
*  divide and conquer algorithm.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.
*
*  Because of large use of BLAS of level 3, DSYEVD needs N**2 more
*  workspace than DSYEVX.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
*          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
*          leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
*          upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
*          the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
*          the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
*          On exit, if JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, A contains the
*          orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A.
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then on exit the lower triangle (if UPLO='L')
*          or the upper triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the
*          diagonal, is destroyed.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array,
*                                         dimension (LWORK)
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.
*          If N <= 1,               LWORK must be at least 1.
*          If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least 2*N+1.
*          If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least
*                                                1 + 6*N + 2*N**2.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK and IWORK
*          arrays, returns these values as the first entries of the WORK
*          and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to LWORK or
*          LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LIWORK.
*
*  LIWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array IWORK.
*          If N <= 1,                LIWORK must be at least 1.
*          If JOBZ  = 'N' and N > 1, LIWORK must be at least 1.
*          If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LIWORK must be at least 3 + 5*N.
*
*          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*          routine only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK and
*          IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
*          the WORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to
*          LWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i and JOBZ = 'N', then the algorithm failed
*                to converge; i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
*                tridiagonal form did not converge to zero;
*                if INFO = i and JOBZ = 'V', then the algorithm failed
*                to compute an eigenvalue while working on the submatrix
*                lying in rows and columns INFO/(N+1) through
*                mod(INFO,N+1).
