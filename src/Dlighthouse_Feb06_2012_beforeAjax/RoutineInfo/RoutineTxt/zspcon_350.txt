*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZSPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
*  1-norm) of a complex symmetric packed matrix A using the
*  factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by ZSPTRF.
*
*  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
*  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
*          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
*          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
*          obtain the factor U or L as computed by ZSPTRF, stored as a
*          packed triangular matrix.
*
*  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
*          as determined by ZSPTRF.
*
*  ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The 1-norm of the original matrix A.
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
*          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
