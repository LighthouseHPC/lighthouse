*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZPTTRF computes the L*D*L**H factorization of a complex Hermitian
*  positive definite tridiagonal matrix A.  The factorization may also
*  be regarded as having the form A = U**H *D*U.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
*          A.  On exit, the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix
*          D from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.
*
*  E       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix A.  On exit, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the
*          unit bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.
*          E can also be regarded as the superdiagonal of the unit
*          bidiagonal factor U from the U**H *D*U factorization of A.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = k, the leading minor of order k is not
*               positive definite; if k < N, the factorization could not
*               be completed, while if k = N, the factorization was
*               completed, but D(N) <= 0.
