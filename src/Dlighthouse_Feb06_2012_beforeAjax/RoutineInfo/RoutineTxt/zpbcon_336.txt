*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZPBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
*  1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite band matrix using
*  the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by
*  ZPBTRF.
*
*  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
*  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangular factor stored in AB;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangular factor stored in AB.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KD      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
*          or the number of sub-diagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
*          A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the band matrix A, stored in the
*          first KD+1 rows of the array.  The j-th column of U or L is
*          stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
*          if UPLO ='U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = U(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO ='L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = L(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
*
*  ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the Hermitian band matrix A.
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
*          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
