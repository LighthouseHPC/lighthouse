*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSYTRI computes the inverse of a real symmetric indefinite matrix
*  A using the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by
*  DSYTRF.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
*          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
*          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
*          used to obtain the factor U or L as computed by DSYTRF.
*
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the (symmetric) inverse of the original
*          matrix.  If UPLO = 'U', the upper triangular part of the
*          inverse is formed and the part of A below the diagonal is not
*          referenced; if UPLO = 'L' the lower triangular part of the
*          inverse is formed and the part of A above the diagonal is
*          not referenced.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
*          as determined by DSYTRF.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) = 0; the matrix is singular and its
*               inverse could not be computed.
