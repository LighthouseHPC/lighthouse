*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a real
*  general band matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm,
*  using the LU factorization computed by DGBTRF.
*
*  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
*  condition number is computed as
*     RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
*          infinity-norm condition number is required:
*          = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
*          = 'I':         Infinity-norm.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KL      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
*
*  KU      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
*          computed by DGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
*          matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
*          the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
*          rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the matrix was
*          interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A.
*          If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
