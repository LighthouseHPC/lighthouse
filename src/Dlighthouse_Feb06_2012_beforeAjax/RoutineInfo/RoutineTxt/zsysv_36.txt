*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZSYSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
*  matrices.
*
*  The diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
*     A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*     A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*  triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
*  1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.  The factored form of A is then
*  used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*          matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the block diagonal matrix D and the
*          multipliers used to obtain the factor U or L from the
*          factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by
*          ZSYTRF.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D, as
*          determined by ZSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns
*          k and IPIV(k) were interchanged, and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1
*          diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0,
*          then rows and columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and
*          D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and
*          IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and
*          -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2
*          diagonal block.
*
*  B       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of WORK.  LWORK >= 1, and for best performance
*          LWORK >= max(1,N*NB), where NB is the optimal blocksize for
*          ZSYTRF.
*          for LWORK < N, TRS will be done with Level BLAS 2
*          for LWORK >= N, TRS will be done with Level BLAS 3
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*               has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
*               exactly singular, so the solution could not be computed.
