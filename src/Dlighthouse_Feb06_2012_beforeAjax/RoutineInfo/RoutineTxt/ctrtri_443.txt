*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CTRTRI computes the inverse of a complex upper or lower triangular
*  matrix A.
*
*  This is the Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
*          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
*
*  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
*          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
*          leading N-by-N upper triangular part of the array A contains
*          the upper triangular matrix, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of the array A contains
*          the lower triangular matrix, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the
*          diagonal elements of A are also not referenced and are
*          assumed to be 1.
*          On exit, the (triangular) inverse of the original matrix, in
*          the same storage format.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, A(i,i) is exactly zero.  The triangular
*               matrix is singular and its inverse can not be computed.
