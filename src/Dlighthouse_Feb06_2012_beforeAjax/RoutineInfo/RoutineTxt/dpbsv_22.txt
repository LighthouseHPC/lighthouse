*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPBSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite band matrix and X
*  and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as
*     A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*     A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U is an upper triangular band matrix, and L is a lower
*  triangular band matrix, with the same number of superdiagonals or
*  subdiagonals as A.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the
*  system of equations A * X = B.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*          matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KD      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
*          or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
*          matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
*          j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
*          as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AB(KD+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KD)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(N,j+KD).
*          See below for further details.
*
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the
*          Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the band
*          matrix A, in the same storage format as A.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
*
*  B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i of A is not
*                positive definite, so the factorization could not be
*                completed, and the solution has not been computed.
