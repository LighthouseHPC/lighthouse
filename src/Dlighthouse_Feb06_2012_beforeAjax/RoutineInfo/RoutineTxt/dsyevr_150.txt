*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSYEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
*  of a real symmetric matrix A.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be
*  selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
*  indices for the desired eigenvalues.
*
*  DSYEVR first reduces the matrix A to tridiagonal form T with a call
*  to DSYTRD.  Then, whenever possible, DSYEVR calls DSTEMR to compute
*  the eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations.  DSTEMR
*  computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
*  eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations
*  (also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
*  orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
*  the various steps of the algorithm are as follows.
*
*  For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
*     (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
*         define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
*         This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
*         cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
*         eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
*         tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
*     (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
*         If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
*         accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
*         the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
*     (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
*         shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
*         the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
*     (d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
*         the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
*         factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.
*
*  The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
*  parameter ABSTOL.

*
*
*  Note 1 : DSYEVR calls DSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
*  on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
*  DSYEVR calls DSTEBZ and SSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
*  when partial spectrum requests are made.
*
*  Normal execution of DSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
*  hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
*  which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default
*  manner.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
*
*  RANGE   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found.
*          = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
*                 will be found.
*          = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
********** For RANGE = 'V' or 'I' and IU - IL < N - 1, DSTEBZ and
********** DSTEIN are called
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
*          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
*          leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
*          upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
*          the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
*          the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
*          On exit, the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') or the upper
*          triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the diagonal, is
*          destroyed.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  VL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*  VU      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
*          be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
*
*  IL      (input) INTEGER
*  IU      (input) INTEGER
*          If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
*          smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
*          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
*
*  ABSTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
*          An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
*          when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
*          of width less than or equal to
*
*                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
*
*          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
*          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
*          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
*          by reducing A to tridiagonal form.
*
*          See "Computing Small Singular Values of Bidiagonal Matrices
*          with Guaranteed High Relative Accuracy," by Demmel and
*          Kahan, LAPACK Working Note #3.
*
*          If high relative accuracy is important, set ABSTOL to
*          DLAMCH( 'Safe minimum' ).  Doing so will guarantee that
*          eigenvalues are computed to high relative accuracy when
*          possible in future releases.  The current code does not
*          make any guarantees about high relative accuracy, but
*          future releases will. See J. Barlow and J. Demmel,
*          "Computing Accurate Eigensystems of Scaled Diagonally
*          Dominant Matrices", LAPACK Working Note #7, for a discussion
*          of which matrices define their eigenvalues to high relative
*          accuracy.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
*          If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
*
*  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The first M elements contain the selected eigenvalues in
*          ascending order.
*
*  Z       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
*          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
*          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
*          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
*          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
*          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
*          Supplying N columns is always safe.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  ISUPPZ  (output) INTEGER array, dimension ( 2*max(1,M) )
*          The support of the eigenvectors in Z, i.e., the indices
*          indicating the nonzero elements in Z. The i-th eigenvector
*          is nonzero only in elements ISUPPZ( 2*i-1 ) through
*          ISUPPZ( 2*i ).
********** Implemented only for RANGE = 'A' or 'I' and IU - IL = N - 1
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,26*N).
*          For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+6)*N,
*          where NB is the max of the blocksize for DSYTRD and DORMTR
*          returned by ILAENV.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LIWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array IWORK.  LIWORK >= max(1,10*N).
*
*          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*          routine only calculates the optimal size of the IWORK array,
*          returns this value as the first entry of the IWORK array, and
*          no error message related to LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  Internal error
