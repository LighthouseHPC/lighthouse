ZUPGTR generates a complex unitary matrix Q which is defined as the
product of n-1 elementary reflectors H(i) of order n, as returned by
ZHPTRD using packed storage:
if UPLO = 'U', Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1),
if UPLO = 'L', Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U': Upper triangular packed storage used in previous
                call to ZHPTRD;
         = 'L': Lower triangular packed storage used in previous
                call to ZHPTRD.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix Q. N >= 0.
\param[in] AP
         AP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         The vectors which define the elementary reflectors, as
         returned by ZHPTRD.
\param[in] TAU
         TAU is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
         reflector H(i), as returned by ZHPTRD.
\param[out] Q
         Q is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDQ,N)
         The N-by-N unitary matrix Q.
\param[in] LDQ
         LDQ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Q. LDQ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
