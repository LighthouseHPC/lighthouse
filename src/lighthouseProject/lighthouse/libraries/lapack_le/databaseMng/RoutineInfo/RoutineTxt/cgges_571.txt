CGGES computes for a pair of N-by-N complex nonsymmetric matrices
(A,B), the generalized eigenvalues, the generalized complex Schur
form (S, T), and optionally left and/or right Schur vectors (VSL
and VSR). This gives the generalized Schur factorization
        (A,B) = ( (VSL)*S*(VSR)**H, (VSL)*T*(VSR)**H )
where (VSR)**H is the conjugate-transpose of VSR.
Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues so that a selected cluster
of eigenvalues appears in the leading diagonal blocks of the upper
triangular matrix S and the upper triangular matrix T. The leading
columns of VSL and VSR then form an unitary basis for the
corresponding left and right eigenspaces (deflating subspaces).
(If only the generalized eigenvalues are needed, use the driver
CGGEV instead, which is faster.)
A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar w
or a ratio alpha/beta = w, such that  A - w*B is singular.  It is
usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as there is a
reasonable interpretation for beta=0, and even for both being zero.
A pair of matrices (S,T) is in generalized complex Schur form if S
and T are upper triangular and, in addition, the diagonal elements
of T are non-negative real numbers.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBVSL
         JOBVSL is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the left Schur vectors;
         = 'V':  compute the left Schur vectors.
\param[in] JOBVSR
         JOBVSR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the right Schur vectors;
         = 'V':  compute the right Schur vectors.
\param[in] SORT
         SORT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not to order the eigenvalues on the
         diagonal of the generalized Schur form.
         = 'N':  Eigenvalues are not ordered;
         = 'S':  Eigenvalues are ordered (see SELCTG).
\param[in] SELCTG
         SELCTG is a LOGICAL FUNCTION of two COMPLEX arguments
         SELCTG must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling subroutine.
         If SORT = 'N', SELCTG is not referenced.
         If SORT = 'S', SELCTG is used to select eigenvalues to sort
         to the top left of the Schur form.
         An eigenvalue ALPHA(j)/BETA(j) is selected if
         SELCTG(ALPHA(j),BETA(j)) is true.
         Note that a selected complex eigenvalue may no longer satisfy
         SELCTG(ALPHA(j),BETA(j)) = .TRUE. after ordering, since
         ordering may change the value of complex eigenvalues
         (especially if the eigenvalue is ill-conditioned), in this
         case INFO is set to N+2 (See INFO below).
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A, B, VSL, and VSR.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the first of the pair of matrices.
         On exit, A has been overwritten by its generalized Schur
         form S.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB, N)
         On entry, the second of the pair of matrices.
         On exit, B has been overwritten by its generalized Schur
         form T.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] SDIM
         SDIM is INTEGER
         If SORT = 'N', SDIM = 0.
         If SORT = 'S', SDIM = number of eigenvalues (after sorting)
         for which SELCTG is true.
\param[out] ALPHA
         ALPHA is COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
\param[out] BETA
         BETA is COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
         On exit,  ALPHA(j)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will be the
         generalized eigenvalues.  ALPHA(j), j=1,...,N  and  BETA(j),
         j=1,...,N  are the diagonals of the complex Schur form (A,B)
         output by CGGES. The  BETA(j) will be non-negative real.
         Note: the quotients ALPHA(j)/BETA(j) may easily over- or
         underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.  Thus, the user
         should avoid naively computing the ratio alpha/beta.
         However, ALPHA will be always less than and usually
         comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and BETA always less
         than and usually comparable with norm(B).
\param[out] VSL
         VSL is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVSL,N)
         If JOBVSL = 'V', VSL will contain the left Schur vectors.
         Not referenced if JOBVSL = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVSL
         LDVSL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VSL. LDVSL >= 1, and
         if JOBVSL = 'V', LDVSL >= N.
\param[out] VSR
         VSR is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVSR,N)
         If JOBVSR = 'V', VSR will contain the right Schur vectors.
         Not referenced if JOBVSR = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVSR
         LDVSR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VSR. LDVSR >= 1, and
         if JOBVSR = 'V', LDVSR >= N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,2*N).
         For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (8*N)
\param[out] BWORK
         BWORK is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         Not referenced if SORT = 'N'.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         =1,...,N:
               The QZ iteration failed.  (A,B) are not in Schur
               form, but ALPHA(j) and BETA(j) should be correct for
               j=INFO+1,...,N.
         > N:  =N+1: other than QZ iteration failed in CHGEQZ
               =N+2: after reordering, roundoff changed values of
                     some complex eigenvalues so that leading
                     eigenvalues in the Generalized Schur form no
                     longer satisfy SELCTG=.TRUE.  This could also
                     be caused due to scaling.
               =N+3: reordering falied in CTGSEN.
