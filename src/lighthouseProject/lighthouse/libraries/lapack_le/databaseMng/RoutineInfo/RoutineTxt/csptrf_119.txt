CSPTRF computes the factorization of a complex symmetric matrix A
stored in packed format using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting
method:
   A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T
where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
         to obtain the factor U or L, stored as a packed triangular
         matrix overwriting A (see below for further details).
\param[out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
         If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
         If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
         columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
         is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
         IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
              has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
              exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
              is used to solve a system of equations.

 If UPLO = 'U', then A = U*D*U**T, where
    U = P(n)*U(n)* ... *P(k)U(k)* ...,
 i.e., U is a product of terms P(k)*U(k), where k decreases from n to
 1 in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
 defined by IPIV(k), and U(k) is a unit upper triangular matrix, such
 that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then
            (   I    v    0   )   k-s
    U(k) =  (   0    I    0   )   s
            (   0    0    I   )   n-k
               k-s   s   n-k
 If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-1,k).
 If s = 2, the upper triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k-1,k-1), A(k-1,k),
 and A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-2,k-1:k).
 If UPLO = 'L', then A = L*D*L**T, where
    L = P(1)*L(1)* ... *P(k)*L(k)* ...,
 i.e., L is a product of terms P(k)*L(k), where k increases from 1 to
 n in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
 defined by IPIV(k), and L(k) is a unit lower triangular matrix, such
 that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then
            (   I    0     0   )  k-1
    L(k) =  (   0    I     0   )  s
            (   0    v     I   )  n-k-s+1
               k-1   s  n-k-s+1
 If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(k+1:n,k).
 If s = 2, the lower triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k,k), A(k+1,k),
 and A(k+1,k+1), and v overwrites A(k+2:n,k:k+1).
