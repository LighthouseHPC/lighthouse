SSTEBZ computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal
matrix T.  The user may ask for all eigenvalues, all eigenvalues
in the half-open interval (VL, VU], or the IL-th through IU-th
eigenvalues.
To avoid overflow, the matrix must be scaled so that its
largest element is no greater than overflow**(1/2) * underflow**(1/4) in absolute value, and for greatest
accuracy, it should not be much smaller than that.

Matrix", Report CS41, Computer Science Dept., Stanford
University, July 21, 1966.
Arguments:
\param[in] RANGE
         RANGE is CHARACTER*1
         = 'A': ("All")   all eigenvalues will be found.
         = 'V': ("Value") all eigenvalues in the half-open interval
                          (VL, VU] will be found.
         = 'I': ("Index") the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues (of the
                          entire matrix) will be found.
\param[in] ORDER
         ORDER is CHARACTER*1
         = 'B': ("By Block") the eigenvalues will be grouped by
                             split-off block (see IBLOCK, ISPLIT) and
                             ordered from smallest to largest within
                             the block.
         = 'E': ("Entire matrix")
                             the eigenvalues for the entire matrix
                             will be ordered from smallest to
                             largest.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the tridiagonal matrix T.  N >= 0.
\param[in] VL
         VL is REAL
\param[in] VU
         VU is REAL
         If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
         be searched for eigenvalues.  Eigenvalues less than or equal
         to VL, or greater than VU, will not be returned.  VL < VU.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
\param[in] IL
         IL is INTEGER
\param[in] IU
         IU is INTEGER
         If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
         smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
         1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
\param[in] ABSTOL
         ABSTOL is REAL
         The absolute tolerance for the eigenvalues.  An eigenvalue
         (or cluster) is considered to be located if it has been
         determined to lie in an interval whose width is ABSTOL or
         less.  If ABSTOL is less than or equal to zero, then ULP*|T|
         will be used, where |T| means the 1-norm of T.
         Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
         set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
\param[in] D
         D is REAL array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
\param[in] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The actual number of eigenvalues found. 0 <= M <= N.
         (See also the description of INFO=2,3.)
\param[out] NSPLIT
         NSPLIT is INTEGER
         The number of diagonal blocks in the matrix T.
         1 <= NSPLIT <= N.
\param[out] W
         W is REAL array, dimension (N)
         On exit, the first M elements of W will contain the
         eigenvalues.  (SSTEBZ may use the remaining N-M elements as
         workspace.)
\param[out] IBLOCK
         IBLOCK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         At each row/column j where E(j) is zero or small, the
         matrix T is considered to split into a block diagonal
         matrix.  On exit, if INFO = 0, IBLOCK(i) specifies to which
         block (from 1 to the number of blocks) the eigenvalue W(i)
         belongs.  (SSTEBZ may use the remaining N-M elements as
         workspace.)
\param[out] ISPLIT
         ISPLIT is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The splitting points, at which T breaks up into submatrices.
         The first submatrix consists of rows/columns 1 to ISPLIT(1),
         the second of rows/columns ISPLIT(1)+1 through ISPLIT(2),
         etc., and the NSPLIT-th consists of rows/columns
         ISPLIT(NSPLIT-1)+1 through ISPLIT(NSPLIT)=N.
         (Only the first NSPLIT elements will actually be used, but
         since the user cannot know a priori what value NSPLIT will
         have, N words must be reserved for ISPLIT.)
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (4*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (3*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  some or all of the eigenvalues failed to converge or
               were not computed:
               =1 or 3: Bisection failed to converge for some
                       eigenvalues; these eigenvalues are flagged by a
                       negative block number.  The effect is that the
                       eigenvalues may not be as accurate as the
                       absolute and relative tolerances.  This is
                       generally caused by unexpectedly inaccurate
                       arithmetic.
               =2 or 3: RANGE='I' only: Not all of the eigenvalues
                       IL:IU were found.
                       Effect: M < IU+1-IL
                       Cause:  non-monotonic arithmetic, causing the
                               Sturm sequence to be non-monotonic.
                       Cure:   recalculate, using RANGE='A', and pick
                               out eigenvalues IL:IU.  In some cases,
                               increasing the PARAMETER "FUDGE" may
                               make things work.
               = 4:    RANGE='I', and the Gershgorin interval
                       initially used was too small.  No eigenvalues
                       were computed.
                       Probable cause: your machine has sloppy
                                       floating-point arithmetic.
                       Cure: Increase the PARAMETER "FUDGE",
                             recompile, and try again.
\par Internal Parameters:
 RELFAC  REAL, default = 2.0e0
         The relative tolerance.  An interval (a,b] lies within
         "relative tolerance" if  b-a < RELFAC*ulp*max(|a|,|b|),
         where "ulp" is the machine precision (distance from 1 to
         the next larger floating point number.)
 FUDGE   REAL, default = 2
         A "fudge factor" to widen the Gershgorin intervals.  Ideally,
         a value of 1 should work, but on machines with sloppy
         arithmetic, this needs to be larger.  The default for
         publicly released versions should be large enough to handle
         the worst machine around.  Note that this has no effect
         on accuracy of the solution.
