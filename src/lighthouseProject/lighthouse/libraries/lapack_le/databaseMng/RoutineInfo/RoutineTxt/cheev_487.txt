CHEEV computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
complex Hermitian matrix A.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
         leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
         upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
         the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
         the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
         On exit, if JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, A contains the
         orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then on exit the lower triangle (if UPLO='L')
         or the upper triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the
         diagonal, is destroyed.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] W
         W is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,2*N-1).
         For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+1)*N,
         where NB is the blocksize for CHETRD returned by ILAENV.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (max(1, 3*N-2))
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the algorithm failed to converge; i
               off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal
               form did not converge to zero.
