DTGSYL solves the generalized Sylvester equation:
            A * R - L * B = scale * C                 (1)
            D * R - L * E = scale * F
where R and L are unknown m-by-n matrices, (A, D), (B, E) and
(C, F) are given matrix pairs of size m-by-m, n-by-n and m-by-n,
respectively, with real entries. (A, D) and (B, E) must be in
generalized (real) Schur canonical form, i.e. A, B are upper quasi
triangular and D, E are upper triangular.
The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 <= SCALE <= 1 is an output
scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.
In matrix notation (1) is equivalent to solve  Zx = scale b, where
Z is defined as
           Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**T, Im) ]         (2)
               [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**T, Im) ].
Here Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X**T is the transpose of
X. kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.
If TRANS = 'T', DTGSYL solves the transposed system Z**T*y = scale*b,
which is equivalent to solve for R and L in
            A**T * R + D**T * L = scale * C           (3)
            R * B**T + L * E**T = scale * -F
This case (TRANS = 'T') is used to compute an one-norm-based estimate
of Dif[(A,D), (B,E)], the separation between the matrix pairs (A,D)
and (B,E), using DLACON.
If IJOB >= 1, DTGSYL computes a Frobenius norm-based estimate
of Dif[(A,D),(B,E)]. That is, the reciprocal of a lower bound on the
reciprocal of the smallest singular value of Z. See [1-2] for more
information.
This is a level 3 BLAS algorithm.
