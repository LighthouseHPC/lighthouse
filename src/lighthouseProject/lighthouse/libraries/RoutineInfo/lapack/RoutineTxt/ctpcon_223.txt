CTPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a packed
triangular matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.
The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
computed as
   RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
Arguments:
\param[in] NORM
         NORM is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
         infinity-norm condition number is required:
         = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
         = 'I':         Infinity-norm.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
         = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
\param[in] DIAG
         DIAG is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
         = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] AP
         AP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         The upper or lower triangular matrix A, packed columnwise in
         a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored in the array
         AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
         and are assumed to be 1.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is REAL
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
