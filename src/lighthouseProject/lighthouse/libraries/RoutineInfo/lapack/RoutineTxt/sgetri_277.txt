SGETRI computes the inverse of a matrix using the LU factorization
computed by SGETRF.
This method inverts U and then computes inv(A) by solving the system
inv(A)*L = inv(U) for inv(A).
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the factors L and U from the factorization
         A = P*L*U as computed by SGETRF.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the inverse of the original matrix A.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices from SGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
         matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO=0, then WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N).
         For optimal performance LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is
         the optimal blocksize returned by ILAENV.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero; the matrix is
               singular and its inverse could not be computed.
