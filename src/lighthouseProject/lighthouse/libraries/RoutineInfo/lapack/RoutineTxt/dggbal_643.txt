DGGBAL balances a pair of general real matrices (A,B).  This
involves, first, permuting A and B by similarity transformations to
isolate eigenvalues in the first 1 to ILO$-$1 and last IHI+1 to N
elements on the diagonal; and second, applying a diagonal similarity
transformation to rows and columns ILO to IHI to make the rows
and columns as close in norm as possible. Both steps are optional.
Balancing may reduce the 1-norm of the matrices, and improve the
accuracy of the computed eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors in the
generalized eigenvalue problem A*x = lambda*B*x.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOB
         JOB is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the operations to be performed on A and B:
         = 'N':  none:  simply set ILO = 1, IHI = N, LSCALE(I) = 1.0
                 and RSCALE(I) = 1.0 for i = 1,...,N.
         = 'P':  permute only;
         = 'S':  scale only;
         = 'B':  both permute and scale.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the input matrix A.
         On exit,  A is overwritten by the balanced matrix.
         If JOB = 'N', A is not referenced.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,N)
         On entry, the input matrix B.
         On exit,  B is overwritten by the balanced matrix.
         If JOB = 'N', B is not referenced.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] ILO
         ILO is INTEGER
\param[out] IHI
         IHI is INTEGER
         ILO and IHI are set to integers such that on exit
         A(i,j) = 0 and B(i,j) = 0 if i > j and
         j = 1,...,ILO-1 or i = IHI+1,...,N.
         If JOB = 'N' or 'S', ILO = 1 and IHI = N.
\param[out] LSCALE
         LSCALE is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied
         to the left side of A and B.  If P(j) is the index of the
         row interchanged with row j, and D(j)
         is the scaling factor applied to row j, then
           LSCALE(j) = P(j)    for J = 1,...,ILO-1
                     = D(j)    for J = ILO,...,IHI
                     = P(j)    for J = IHI+1,...,N.
         The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
         then 1 to ILO-1.
\param[out] RSCALE
         RSCALE is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied
         to the right side of A and B.  If P(j) is the index of the
         column interchanged with column j, and D(j)
         is the scaling factor applied to column j, then
           LSCALE(j) = P(j)    for J = 1,...,ILO-1
                     = D(j)    for J = ILO,...,IHI
                     = P(j)    for J = IHI+1,...,N.
         The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
         then 1 to ILO-1.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (lwork)
         lwork must be at least max(1,6*N) when JOB = 'S' or 'B', and
         at least 1 when JOB = 'N' or 'P'.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
