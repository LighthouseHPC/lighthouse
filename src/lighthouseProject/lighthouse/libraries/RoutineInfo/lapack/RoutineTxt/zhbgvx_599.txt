ZHBGVX computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite banded eigenproblem, of
the form A*x=(lambda)*B*x. Here A and B are assumed to be Hermitian
and banded, and B is also positive definite.  Eigenvalues and
eigenvectors can be selected by specifying either all eigenvalues,
a range of values or a range of indices for the desired eigenvalues.

         = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
                will be found;
         = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
\param[in] UPLO

         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band
         matrix A, stored in the first ka+1 rows of the array.  The
         j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(ka+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ka)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+ka).
         On exit, the contents of AB are destroyed.

         j-th column of B is stored in the j-th column of the array BB
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', BB(kb+1+i-j,j) = B(i,j) for max(1,j-kb)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', BB(1+i-j,j)    = B(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kb).

         Q is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDQ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', the n-by-n matrix used in the reduction of
         A*x = (lambda)*B*x to standard form, i.e. C*x = (lambda)*x,
         and consequently C to tridiagonal form.
         If JOBZ = 'N', the array Q is not referenced.

         VU is DOUBLE PRECISION
         If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
         be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
\param[in] IL
         IL is INTEGER
\param[in] IU
         IU is INTEGER
         If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
         smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
         1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
\param[in] ABSTOL
         ABSTOL is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
         An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
         when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
         of width less than or equal to
                 ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
         where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
         or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
         where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
         by reducing AP to tridiagonal form.
         Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
         set to twice the underflow threshold 2*DLAMCH('S'), not zero.
         If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
         eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
         2*DLAMCH('S').
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
         If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
\param[out] W
         W is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] Z
         Z is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the matrix Z of
         eigenvectors, with the i-th column of Z holding the
         eigenvector associated with W(i). The eigenvectors are
         normalized so that Z**H*B*Z = I.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (7*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (5*N)
\param[out] IFAIL
         IFAIL is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
         IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
         indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is:
            <= N:  then i eigenvectors failed to converge.  Their
                   indices are stored in array IFAIL.
            > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= N, then ZPBSTF
                   returned INFO = i: B is not positive definite.
                   The factorization of B could not be completed and
                   no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
