ZHSEIN uses inverse iteration to find specified right and/or left
eigenvectors of a complex upper Hessenberg matrix H.
The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of the matrix H
corresponding to an eigenvalue w are defined by:
             H * x = w * x,     y**h * H = w * y**h
where y**h denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector y.
Arguments:
\param[in] SIDE
         SIDE is CHARACTER*1
         = 'R': compute right eigenvectors only;
         = 'L': compute left eigenvectors only;
         = 'B': compute both right and left eigenvectors.
\param[in] EIGSRC
         EIGSRC is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the source of eigenvalues supplied in W:
         = 'Q': the eigenvalues were found using ZHSEQR; thus, if
                H has zero subdiagonal elements, and so is
                block-triangular, then the j-th eigenvalue can be
                assumed to be an eigenvalue of the block containing
                the j-th row/column.  This property allows ZHSEIN to
                perform inverse iteration on just one diagonal block.
         = 'N': no assumptions are made on the correspondence
                between eigenvalues and diagonal blocks.  In this
                case, ZHSEIN must always perform inverse iteration
                using the whole matrix H.
\param[in] INITV
         INITV is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': no initial vectors are supplied;
         = 'U': user-supplied initial vectors are stored in the arrays
                VL and/or VR.
\param[in] SELECT
         SELECT is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         Specifies the eigenvectors to be computed. To select the
         eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue W(j),
         SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE..
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix H.  N >= 0.
\param[in] H
         H is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDH,N)
         The upper Hessenberg matrix H.
         If a NaN is detected in H, the routine will return with INFO=-6.
\param[in] LDH
         LDH is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array H.  LDH >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] W
         W is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
         On entry, the eigenvalues of H.
         On exit, the real parts of W may have been altered since
         close eigenvalues are perturbed slightly in searching for
         independent eigenvectors.
\param[in,out] VL
         VL is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDVL,MM)
         On entry, if INITV = 'U' and SIDE = 'L' or 'B', VL must
         contain starting vectors for the inverse iteration for the
         left eigenvectors; the starting vector for each eigenvector
         must be in the same column in which the eigenvector will be
         stored.
         On exit, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B', the left eigenvectors
         specified by SELECT will be stored consecutively in the
         columns of VL, in the same order as their eigenvalues.
         If SIDE = 'R', VL is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VL.
         LDVL >= max(1,N) if SIDE = 'L' or 'B'; LDVL >= 1 otherwise.
\param[in,out] VR
         VR is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDVR,MM)
         On entry, if INITV = 'U' and SIDE = 'R' or 'B', VR must
         contain starting vectors for the inverse iteration for the
         right eigenvectors; the starting vector for each eigenvector
         must be in the same column in which the eigenvector will be
         stored.
         On exit, if SIDE = 'R' or 'B', the right eigenvectors
         specified by SELECT will be stored consecutively in the
         columns of VR, in the same order as their eigenvalues.
         If SIDE = 'L', VR is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VR.
         LDVR >= max(1,N) if SIDE = 'R' or 'B'; LDVR >= 1 otherwise.
\param[in] MM
         MM is INTEGER
         The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR. MM >= M.
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR required to
         store the eigenvectors (= the number of .TRUE. elements in
         SELECT).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] IFAILL
         IFAILL is INTEGER array, dimension (MM)
         If SIDE = 'L' or 'B', IFAILL(i) = j > 0 if the left
         eigenvector in the i-th column of VL (corresponding to the
         eigenvalue w(j)) failed to converge; IFAILL(i) = 0 if the
         eigenvector converged satisfactorily.
         If SIDE = 'R', IFAILL is not referenced.
\param[out] IFAILR
         IFAILR is INTEGER array, dimension (MM)
         If SIDE = 'R' or 'B', IFAILR(i) = j > 0 if the right
         eigenvector in the i-th column of VR (corresponding to the
         eigenvalue w(j)) failed to converge; IFAILR(i) = 0 if the
         eigenvector converged satisfactorily.
         If SIDE = 'L', IFAILR is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, i is the number of eigenvectors which
               failed to converge; see IFAILL and IFAILR for further
               details.
