CHETRD reduces a complex Hermitian matrix A to real symmetric
tridiagonal form T by a unitary similarity transformation:
Q**H * A * Q = T.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
         N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
         leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
         triangular part of A is not referenced.
         On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
         of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
         tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
         superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the unitary
         matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
         = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
         written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
         matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
         the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q as a product
         of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] D
         D is REAL array, dimension (N)
         The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
         D(i) = A(i,i).
\param[out] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
         E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.
\param[out] TAU
         TAU is COMPLEX array, dimension (N-1)
         The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
         Details).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= 1.
         For optimum performance LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the
         optimal blocksize.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

\par Further Details:
 If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
 reflectors
    Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).
 Each H(i) has the form
    H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H
 where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
 v(i+1:n) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in
 A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau in TAU(i).
 If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
 reflectors
    Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
 Each H(i) has the form
    H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H
 where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
 v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in A(i+2:n,i),
 and tau in TAU(i).
 The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
 with n = 5:
 if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':
   (  d   e   v2  v3  v4 )              (  d                  )
   (      d   e   v3  v4 )              (  e   d              )
   (          d   e   v4 )              (  v1  e   d          )
   (              d   e  )              (  v1  v2  e   d      )
   (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  v3  e   d  )
 where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of T, and vi
 denotes an element of the vector defining H(i).
