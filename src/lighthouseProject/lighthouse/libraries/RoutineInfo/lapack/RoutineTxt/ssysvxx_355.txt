   SSYSVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
   solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B, where A
   is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
   If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
   are returned. SSYSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
   guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
   precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
   case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
   calculated and returned.
   SSYSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
   factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
   Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
   SSYSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
   errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
   user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
   differ from what SSYSVXX would itself produce.
\par Description:
   The following steps are performed:
   1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
   the system:
     diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B
   Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
   scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
   overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.
   2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
   the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
      A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
      A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
   where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
   triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
   1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
   3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
   routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
   is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
   argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
   less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
   for X and compute error bounds as described below.
   4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
   of A.
   5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
   the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
   error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
   least twice the working precision.
   6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
   diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
   equilibration.
Arguments:
    Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
    settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
    defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
    can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
    the PARAMS argument.
\param[in] FACT
         FACT is CHARACTER*1
    Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
    supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
    equilibrated before it is factored.
      = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
              If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
              equilibrated with scaling factors given by S.
              A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
      = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
      = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
              copied to AF and factored.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
      = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
      = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
    The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
    matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
    The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
    of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
    The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
    upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
    part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
    part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
    N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
    triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
    triangular part of A is not referenced.
    On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
    diag(S)*A*diag(S).
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] AF
         AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
    If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
    contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
    used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
    U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by SSYTRF.
    If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
    returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
    used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
    U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T.
\param[in] LDAF
         LDAF is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
    If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
    contains details of the interchanges and the block
    structure of D, as determined by SSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) > 0,
    then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
    D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
    IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
    -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
    diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) < 0,
    then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
    and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
    If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
    contains details of the interchanges and the block
    structure of D, as determined by SSYTRF.
\param[in,out] EQUED
         EQUED is CHARACTER*1
    Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
      = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
      = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
              replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
    EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
    output argument.
\param[in,out] S
         S is REAL array, dimension (N)
    The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
    the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
    'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
    = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
    element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
    of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
    and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
    rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
    Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
    is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
    that may not be reliable.
\param[in,out] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
    On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
    On exit,
    if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
    if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] X
         X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
    If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
    system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
    EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
    inv(diag(S))*X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is REAL
    Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
    reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
    equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
    precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
    to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
    if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
    conditioned.
\param[out] RPVGRW
         RPVGRW is REAL
    Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
    pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
    norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
    the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
    This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
    and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
    0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
    for the leading INFO columns of A.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
    Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
    componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
    (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
    makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
         N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
    Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
    and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
    ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
\param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
         ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
    For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
    various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
    normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
    Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
            max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
           ------------------------------
                 max_j abs(X(j,i))
    The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
    below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
    returned.
    The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
    right-hand side.
    The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
    three fields:
    err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
             reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
             sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').
    err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
             almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
             so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
             sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
             be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
    err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
             reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
             sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
             estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
             numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
             appropriately scaled matrix Z.
             Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
             radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.
    See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
    cautions.
\param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
         ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
    For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
    various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
    componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
    Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                   abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
            max_j ----------------------
                        abs(X(j,i))
    The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
    componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
    information as described below. There currently are up to three
    pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
    componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
    ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
    the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.
    The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
    right-hand side.
    The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
    three fields:
    err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
             reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
             sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').
    err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
             almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
             so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
             sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
             be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
    err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
             reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
             sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
             estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
             numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
             appropriately scaled matrix Z.
             Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
             current right-hand side and S scales each row of
             A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
             sums of Z are approximately 1.
    See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
    cautions.
\param[in] NPARAMS
         NPARAMS is INTEGER
    Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If .LE. 0, the
    PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
\param[in,out] PARAMS
         PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
    Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is .LT. 0.0, then
    that entry will be filled with default value used for that
    parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
    are used for higher-numbered parameters.
      PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
           refinement or not.
        Default: 1.0
           = 0.0 : No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
                   computed.
           = 1.0 : Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
                   possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                   compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                   PRECISION.
             (other values are reserved for future use)
      PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
           computations allowed for refinement.
        Default: 10
        Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                    factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                    the factorization uses a technique other than
                    Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                    err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                    trustworthy.
      PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
           will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
           relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
           is true, 0.0 is false.
        Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (4*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
      = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
        guaranteed.
      < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
      > 0 and <= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
        has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
        the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
        is returned.
      = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
        not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
        hand sides K with K > J may not be guaranteed as well, but
        only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
        componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
        the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
        bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
        that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)
        the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
        componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
        J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
        ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
        ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,1) and ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,1). To get information
        about all of the right-hand sides check ERR_BNDS_NORM or
        ERR_BNDS_COMP.
