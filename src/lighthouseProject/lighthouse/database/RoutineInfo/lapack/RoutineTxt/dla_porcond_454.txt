   DLA_PORCOND Estimates the Skeel condition number of  op(A) * op2(C)
   where op2 is determined by CMODE as follows
   CMODE =  1    op2(C) = C
   CMODE =  0    op2(C) = I
   CMODE = -1    op2(C) = inv(C)
   The Skeel condition number  cond(A) = norminf( |inv(A)||A| )
   is computed by computing scaling factors R such that
   diag(R)*A*op2(C) is row equilibrated and computing the standard
   infinity-norm condition number.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
      = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
      = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
    The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
    matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
    On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] AF
         AF is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
    The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
    A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by DPOTRF.
\param[in] LDAF
         LDAF is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
\param[in] CMODE
         CMODE is INTEGER
    Determines op2(C) in the formula op(A) * op2(C) as follows:
    CMODE =  1    op2(C) = C
    CMODE =  0    op2(C) = I
    CMODE = -1    op2(C) = inv(C)
\param[in] C
         C is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
    The vector C in the formula op(A) * op2(C).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
      = 0:  Successful exit.
    i > 0:  The ith argument is invalid.
\param[in] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N).
    Workspace.
\param[in] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N).
    Workspace.
