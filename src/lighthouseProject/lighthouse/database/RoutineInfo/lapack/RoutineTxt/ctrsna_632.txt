CTRSNA estimates reciprocal condition numbers for specified
eigenvalues and/or right eigenvectors of a complex upper triangular
matrix T (or of any matrix Q*T*Q**H with Q unitary).
Arguments:
\param[in] JOB
         JOB is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether condition numbers are required for
         eigenvalues (S) or eigenvectors (SEP):
         = 'E': for eigenvalues only (S);
         = 'V': for eigenvectors only (SEP);
         = 'B': for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors (S and SEP).
\param[in] HOWMNY
         HOWMNY is CHARACTER*1
         = 'A': compute condition numbers for all eigenpairs;
         = 'S': compute condition numbers for selected eigenpairs
                specified by the array SELECT.
\param[in] SELECT
         SELECT is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the eigenpairs for which
         condition numbers are required. To select condition numbers
         for the j-th eigenpair, SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE..
         If HOWMNY = 'A', SELECT is not referenced.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.
\param[in] T
         T is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDT,N)
         The upper triangular matrix T.
\param[in] LDT
         LDT is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).
\param[in] VL
         VL is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVL,M)
         If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VL must contain left eigenvectors of T
         (or of any Q*T*Q**H with Q unitary), corresponding to the
         eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY and SELECT. The eigenvectors
         must be stored in consecutive columns of VL, as returned by
         CHSEIN or CTREVC.
         If JOB = 'V', VL is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VL.
         LDVL >= 1; and if JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVL >= N.
\param[in] VR
         VR is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVR,M)
         If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VR must contain right eigenvectors of T
         (or of any Q*T*Q**H with Q unitary), corresponding to the
         eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY and SELECT. The eigenvectors
         must be stored in consecutive columns of VR, as returned by
         CHSEIN or CTREVC.
         If JOB = 'V', VR is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VR.
         LDVR >= 1; and if JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVR >= N.
\param[out] S
         S is REAL array, dimension (MM)
         If JOB = 'E' or 'B', the reciprocal condition numbers of the
         selected eigenvalues, stored in consecutive elements of the
         array. Thus S(j), SEP(j), and the j-th columns of VL and VR
         all correspond to the same eigenpair (but not in general the
         j-th eigenpair, unless all eigenpairs are selected).
         If JOB = 'V', S is not referenced.
\param[out] SEP
         SEP is REAL array, dimension (MM)
         If JOB = 'V' or 'B', the estimated reciprocal condition
         numbers of the selected eigenvectors, stored in consecutive
         elements of the array.
         If JOB = 'E', SEP is not referenced.
\param[in] MM
         MM is INTEGER
         The number of elements in the arrays S (if JOB = 'E' or 'B')
          and/or SEP (if JOB = 'V' or 'B'). MM >= M.
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of elements of the arrays S and/or SEP actually
         used to store the estimated condition numbers.
         If HOWMNY = 'A', M is set to N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDWORK,N+6)
         If JOB = 'E', WORK is not referenced.
\param[in] LDWORK
         LDWORK is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array WORK.
         LDWORK >= 1; and if JOB = 'V' or 'B', LDWORK >= N.
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If JOB = 'E', RWORK is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

 The reciprocal of the condition number of an eigenvalue lambda is
 defined as
         S(lambda) = |v**H*u| / (norm(u)*norm(v))
 where u and v are the right and left eigenvectors of T corresponding
 to lambda; v**H denotes the conjugate transpose of v, and norm(u)
 denotes the Euclidean norm. These reciprocal condition numbers always
 lie between zero (very badly conditioned) and one (very well
 conditioned). If n = 1, S(lambda) is defined to be 1.
 An approximate error bound for a computed eigenvalue W(i) is given by
                     EPS * norm(T) / S(i)
 where EPS is the machine precision.
 The reciprocal of the condition number of the right eigenvector u
 corresponding to lambda is defined as follows. Suppose
             T = ( lambda  c  )
                 (   0    T22 )
 Then the reciprocal condition number is
         SEP( lambda, T22 ) = sigma-min( T22 - lambda*I )
 where sigma-min denotes the smallest singular value. We approximate
 the smallest singular value by the reciprocal of an estimate of the
 one-norm of the inverse of T22 - lambda*I. If n = 1, SEP(1) is
 defined to be abs(T(1,1)).
 An approximate error bound for a computed right eigenvector VR(i)
 is given by
                     EPS * norm(T) / SEP(i)
