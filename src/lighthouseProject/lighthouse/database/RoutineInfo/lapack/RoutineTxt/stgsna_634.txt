STGSNA estimates reciprocal condition numbers for specified
eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors of a matrix pair (A, B) in
generalized real Schur canonical form (or of any matrix pair
(Q*A*Z**T, Q*B*Z**T) with orthogonal matrices Q and Z, where
Z**T denotes the transpose of Z.
(A, B) must be in generalized real Schur form (as returned by SGGES),
i.e. A is block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal
blocks. B is upper triangular.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOB
         JOB is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether condition numbers are required for
         eigenvalues (S) or eigenvectors (DIF):
         = 'E': for eigenvalues only (S);
         = 'V': for eigenvectors only (DIF);
         = 'B': for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors (S and DIF).
\param[in] HOWMNY
         HOWMNY is CHARACTER*1
         = 'A': compute condition numbers for all eigenpairs;
         = 'S': compute condition numbers for selected eigenpairs
                specified by the array SELECT.
\param[in] SELECT
         SELECT is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the eigenpairs for which
         condition numbers are required. To select condition numbers
         for the eigenpair corresponding to a real eigenvalue w(j),
         SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE.. To select condition numbers
         corresponding to a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues w(j)
         and w(j+1), either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) or both, must be
         set to .TRUE..
         If HOWMNY = 'A', SELECT is not referenced.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the square matrix pair (A, B). N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The upper quasi-triangular matrix A in the pair (A,B).
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,N)
         The upper triangular matrix B in the pair (A,B).
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in] VL
         VL is REAL array, dimension (LDVL,M)
         If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VL must contain left eigenvectors of
         (A, B), corresponding to the eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY
         and SELECT. The eigenvectors must be stored in consecutive
         columns of VL, as returned by STGEVC.
         If JOB = 'V', VL is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VL. LDVL >= 1.
         If JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVL >= N.
\param[in] VR
         VR is REAL array, dimension (LDVR,M)
         If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VR must contain right eigenvectors of
         (A, B), corresponding to the eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY
         and SELECT. The eigenvectors must be stored in consecutive
         columns ov VR, as returned by STGEVC.
         If JOB = 'V', VR is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER

         If JOB = 'E' or 'B', the reciprocal condition numbers of the
         selected eigenvalues, stored in consecutive elements of the
         array. For a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues two
         consecutive elements of S are set to the same value. Thus
         S(j), DIF(j), and the j-th columns of VL and VR all
         correspond to the same eigenpair (but not in general the
         j-th eigenpair, unless all eigenpairs are selected).
         If JOB = 'V', S is not referenced.
\param[out] DIF
         DIF is REAL array, dimension (MM)
         If JOB = 'V' or 'B', the estimated reciprocal condition
         numbers of the selected eigenvectors, stored in consecutive
         elements of the array. For a complex eigenvector two
         consecutive elements of DIF are set to the same value. If
         the eigenvalues cannot be reordered to compute DIF(j), DIF(j)
         is set to 0; this can only occur when the true value would be
         very small anyway.
         If JOB = 'E', DIF is not referenced.
\param[in] MM
         MM is INTEGER
         The number of elements in the arrays S and DIF. MM >= M.
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of elements of the arrays S and DIF used to store
         the specified condition numbers; for each selected real
         eigenvalue one element is used, and for each selected complex
         conjugate pair of eigenvalues, two elements are used.
         If HOWMNY = 'A', M is set to N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,N).
         If JOB = 'V' or 'B' LWORK >= 2*N*(N+2)+16.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N + 6)
         If JOB = 'E', IWORK is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         =0: Successful exit
         <0: If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

\par Further Details:
 The reciprocal of the condition number of a generalized eigenvalue
 w = (a, b) is defined as
      S(w) = (|u**TAv|**2 + |u**TBv|**2)**(1/2) / (norm(u)*norm(v))
 where u and v are the left and right eigenvectors of (A, B)
 corresponding to w; |z| denotes the absolute value of the complex
 number, and norm(u) denotes the 2-norm of the vector u.
 The pair (a, b) corresponds to an eigenvalue w = a/b (= u**TAv/u**TBv)
 of the matrix pair (A, B). If both a and b equal zero, then (A B) is
 singular and S(I) = -1 is returned.
 An approximate error bound on the chordal distance between the i-th
 computed generalized eigenvalue w and the corresponding exact
 eigenvalue lambda is
      chord(w, lambda) <= EPS * norm(A, B) / S(I)
 where EPS is the machine precision.
 The reciprocal of the condition number DIF(i) of right eigenvector u
 and left eigenvector v corresponding to the generalized eigenvalue w
 is defined as follows:
 a) If the i-th eigenvalue w = (a,b) is real
    Suppose U and V are orthogonal transformations such that
             U**T*(A, B)*V  = (S, T) = ( a   *  ) ( b  *  )  1
                                       ( 0  S22 ),( 0 T22 )  n-1
                                         1  n-1     1 n-1
    Then the reciprocal condition number DIF(i) is
               Difl((a, b), (S22, T22)) = sigma-min( Zl ),
    where sigma-min(Zl) denotes the smallest singular value of the
    2(n-1)-by-2(n-1) matrix
        Zl = [ kron(a, In-1)  -kron(1, S22) ]
             [ kron(b, In-1)  -kron(1, T22) ] .
    Here In-1 is the identity matrix of size n-1. kron(X, Y) is the
    Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.
    Note that if the default method for computing DIF(i) is wanted
    (see SLATDF), then the parameter DIFDRI (see below) should be
    changed from 3 to 4 (routine SLATDF(IJOB = 2 will be used)).
    See STGSYL for more details.
 b) If the i-th and (i+1)-th eigenvalues are complex conjugate pair,
    Suppose U and V are orthogonal transformations such that
             U**T*(A, B)*V = (S, T) = ( S11  *   ) ( T11  *  )  2
                                      ( 0    S22 ),( 0    T22) n-2
                                        2    n-2     2    n-2
    and (S11, T11) corresponds to the complex conjugate eigenvalue
    pair (w, conjg(w)). There exist unitary matrices U1 and V1 such
    that
      U1**T*S11*V1 = ( s11 s12 ) and U1**T*T11*V1 = ( t11 t12 )
                     (  0  s22 )                    (  0  t22 )
    where the generalized eigenvalues w = s11/t11 and
    conjg(w) = s22/t22.
    Then the reciprocal condition number DIF(i) is bounded by
        min( d1, max( 1, |real(s11)/real(s22)| )*d2 )
    where, d1 = Difl((s11, t11), (s22, t22)) = sigma-min(Z1), where
    Z1 is the complex 2-by-2 matrix
             Z1 =  [ s11  -s22 ]
                   [ t11  -t22 ],
    This is done by computing (using real arithmetic) the
    roots of the characteristical polynomial det(Z1**T * Z1 - lambda I),
    where Z1**T denotes the transpose of Z1 and det(X) denotes
    the determinant of X.
    and d2 is an upper bound on Difl((S11, T11), (S22, T22)), i.e. an
    upper bound on sigma-min(Z2), where Z2 is (2n-2)-by-(2n-2)
             Z2 = [ kron(S11**T, In-2)  -kron(I2, S22) ]
                  [ kron(T11**T, In-2)  -kron(I2, T22) ]
    Note that if the default method for computing DIF is wanted (see
    SLATDF), then the parameter DIFDRI (see below) should be changed
    from 3 to 4 (routine SLATDF(IJOB = 2 will be used)). See STGSYL
    for more details.
 For each eigenvalue/vector specified by SELECT, DIF stores a
 Frobenius norm-based estimate of Difl.
 An approximate error bound for the i-th computed eigenvector VL(i) or
 VR(i) is given by
            EPS * norm(A, B) / DIF(i).
