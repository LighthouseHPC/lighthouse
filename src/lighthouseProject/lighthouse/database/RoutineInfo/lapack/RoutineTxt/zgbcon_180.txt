ZGBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex
general band matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm,
using the LU factorization computed by ZGBTRF.
An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as
   RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
Arguments:
\param[in] NORM
         NORM is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
         infinity-norm condition number is required:
         = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
         = 'I':         Infinity-norm.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KL
         KL is INTEGER
         The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
\param[in] KU
         KU is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
         computed by ZGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
         matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
         the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
         rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the matrix was
         interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[in] ANORM
         ANORM is DOUBLE PRECISION
         If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A.
         If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
