DGTSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a real
system of linear equations A * X = B or A**T * X = B,
where A is a tridiagonal matrix of order N and X and B are N-by-NRHS
matrices.
Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
provided.
\par Description:
The following steps are performed:
1. If FACT = 'N', the LU decomposition is used to factor the matrix A
   as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation and unit lower
   bidiagonal matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in
   only the main diagonal and first two superdiagonals.
2. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
   returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
   to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
   reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
   INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
   to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
   of A.
4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
   matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
   for it.

         contains the (n-1) elements of the first superdiagonal of U.

         U.
\param[in,out] IPIV

         contains the pivot indices from the LU factorization of A as
         computed by DGTTRF.
         If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
         contains the pivot indices from the LU factorization of A;
         row i of the matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
         IPIV(i) will always be either i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates
         a row interchange was not required.

         The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.

         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
         A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
         particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
         precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
         INFO > 0.
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
         overestimate of the true error.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
               <= N:  U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                      has not been completed unless i = N, but the
                      factor U is exactly singular, so the solution
                      and error bounds could not be computed.
                      RCOND = 0 is returned.
               = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                      precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                      to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                      solution and error bounds are computed because
                      there are a number of situations where the
                      computed solution can be more accurate than the
                      value of RCOND would suggest.
