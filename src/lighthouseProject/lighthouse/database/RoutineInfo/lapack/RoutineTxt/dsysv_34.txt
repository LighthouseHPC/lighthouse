DSYSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
   A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
matrices.
The diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
   A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
   A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.  The factored form of A is then
used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
         matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
         N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
         leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
         triangular part of A is not referenced.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the block diagonal matrix D and the
         multipliers used to obtain the factor U or L from the
         factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by
         DSYTRF.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D, as
         determined by DSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns
         k and IPIV(k) were interchanged, and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1
         diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0,
         then rows and columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and
         D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and
         IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and
         -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2
         diagonal block.
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The length of WORK.  LWORK >= 1, and for best performance
         LWORK >= max(1,N*NB), where NB is the optimal blocksize for
         DSYTRF.
         for LWORK < N, TRS will be done with Level BLAS 2
         for LWORK >= N, TRS will be done with Level BLAS 3
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
              has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
              exactly singular, so the solution could not be computed.
