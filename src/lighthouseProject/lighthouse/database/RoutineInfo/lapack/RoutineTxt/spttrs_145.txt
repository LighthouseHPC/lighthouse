SPTTRS solves a tridiagonal system of the form
   A * X = B
using the L*D*L**T factorization of A computed by SPTTRF.  D is a
diagonal matrix specified in the vector D, L is a unit bidiagonal
matrix whose subdiagonal is specified in the vector E, and X and B
are N by NRHS matrices.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the tridiagonal matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] D
         D is REAL array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D from the
         L*D*L**T factorization of A.
\param[in] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit bidiagonal factor
         L from the L*D*L**T factorization of A.  E can also be regarded
         as the superdiagonal of the unit bidiagonal factor U from the
         factorization A = U**T*D*U.
\param[in,out] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side vectors B for the system of
         linear equations.
         On exit, the solution vectors, X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
