SPOSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T to
compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
   A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B
are N-by-NRHS matrices.
Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
provided.
\par Description:
The following steps are performed:
1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
   the system:
      diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
   Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
   scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
   overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.
2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
   factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
      A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
      A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
   where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
   matrix.
3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
   then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
   form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
   A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
   precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
   still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
   described below.
4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
   of A.
5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
   matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
   for it.
6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
   diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
   equilibration.
Arguments:
\param[in] FACT
         FACT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
         supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
         equilibrated before it is factored.
         = 'F':  On entry, AF contains the factored form of A.
                 If EQUED = 'Y', the matrix A has been equilibrated
                 with scaling factors given by S.  A and AF will not
                 be modified.
         = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
         = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                 copied to AF and factored.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
         matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A, except if FACT = 'F' and
         EQUED = 'Y', then A must contain the equilibrated matrix
         diag(S)*A*diag(S).  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
         N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
         leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  A is not modified if
         FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'N' on exit.
         On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
         diag(S)*A*diag(S).
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] AF
         AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
         If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
         contains the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, in the same storage
         format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AF is the factored form
         of the equilibrated matrix diag(S)*A*diag(S).
         If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
         returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the original
         matrix A.
         If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit
         returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the equilibrated
         matrix A (see the description of A for the form of the
         equilibrated matrix).
\param[in] LDAF
         LDAF is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] EQUED
         EQUED is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
         = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
         = 'Y':  Equilibration was done, i.e., A has been replaced by
                 diag(S) * A * diag(S).
         EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
         output argument.
\param[in,out] S
         S is REAL array, dimension (N)
         The scale factors for A; not accessed if EQUED = 'N'.  S is
         an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, S is an output
         argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED = 'Y', each element of S
         must be positive.
\param[in,out] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified; if EQUED = 'Y',
         B is overwritten by diag(S) * B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] X
         X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to
         the original system of equations.  Note that if EQUED = 'Y',
         A and B are modified on exit, and the solution to the
         equilibrated system is inv(diag(S))*X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is REAL
         The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
         A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
         machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
         is singular to working precision.  This condition is
         indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
         overestimate of the true error.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (3*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
               <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
                      not positive definite, so the factorization
                      could not be completed, and the solution has not
                      been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
               = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                      precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                      to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                      solution and error bounds are computed because
                      there are a number of situations where the
                      computed solution can be more accurate than the
                      value of RCOND would suggest.
