CTGSNA estimates reciprocal condition numbers for specified
eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors of a matrix pair (A, B).
(A, B) must be in generalized Schur canonical form, that is, A and
B are both upper triangular.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOB
         JOB is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether condition numbers are required for
         eigenvalues (S) or eigenvectors (DIF):
         = 'E': for eigenvalues only (S);
         = 'V': for eigenvectors only (DIF);
         = 'B': for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors (S and DIF).
\param[in] HOWMNY
         HOWMNY is CHARACTER*1
         = 'A': compute condition numbers for all eigenpairs;
         = 'S': compute condition numbers for selected eigenpairs
                specified by the array SELECT.
\param[in] SELECT
         SELECT is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the eigenpairs for which
         condition numbers are required. To select condition numbers
         for the corresponding j-th eigenvalue and/or eigenvector,
         SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE..
         If HOWMNY = 'A', SELECT is not referenced.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the square matrix pair (A, B). N >= 0.

         A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The upper triangular matrix A in the pair (A,B).
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] B
         B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,N)
         The upper triangular matrix B in the pair (A, B).
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in] VL
         VL is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVL,M)
         IF JOB = 'E' or 'B', VL must contain left eigenvectors of
         (A, B), corresponding to the eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY
         and SELECT.  The eigenvectors must be stored in consecutive
         columns of VL, as returned by CTGEVC.
         If JOB = 'V', VL is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VL. LDVL >= 1; and
         If JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVL >= N.
\param[in] VR
         VR is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVR,M)
         IF JOB = 'E' or 'B', VR must contain right eigenvectors of
         (A, B), corresponding to the eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY
         and SELECT.  The eigenvectors must be stored in consecutive
         columns of VR, as returned by CTGEVC.
         If JOB = 'V', VR is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVR

\param[out] S
         S is REAL array, dimension (MM)
         If JOB = 'E' or 'B', the reciprocal condition numbers of the
         selected eigenvalues, stored in consecutive elements of the
         array.
         If JOB = 'V', S is not referenced.
\param[out] DIF
         DIF is REAL array, dimension (MM)
         If JOB = 'V' or 'B', the estimated reciprocal condition
         numbers of the selected eigenvectors, stored in consecutive
         elements of the array.
         If the eigenvalues cannot be reordered to compute DIF(j),
         DIF(j) is set to 0; this can only occur when the true value
         would be very small anyway.
         For each eigenvalue/vector specified by SELECT, DIF stores
         a Frobenius norm-based estimate of Difl.
         If JOB = 'E', DIF is not referenced.
\param[in] MM
         MM is INTEGER
         The number of elements in the arrays S and DIF. MM >= M.
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of elements of the arrays S and DIF used to store
         the specified condition numbers; for each selected eigenvalue
         one element is used. If HOWMNY = 'A', M is set to N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,N).
         If JOB = 'V' or 'B', LWORK >= max(1,2*N*N).
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N+2)
         If JOB = 'E', IWORK is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: Successful exit
         < 0: If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

\par Further Details:
 The reciprocal of the condition number of the i-th generalized
 eigenvalue w = (a, b) is defined as
         S(I) = (|v**HAu|**2 + |v**HBu|**2)**(1/2) / (norm(u)*norm(v))
 where u and v are the right and left eigenvectors of (A, B)
 corresponding to w; |z| denotes the absolute value of the complex
 number, and norm(u) denotes the 2-norm of the vector u. The pair
 (a, b) corresponds to an eigenvalue w = a/b (= v**HAu/v**HBu) of the
 matrix pair (A, B). If both a and b equal zero, then (A,B) is
 singular and S(I) = -1 is returned.
 An approximate error bound on the chordal distance between the i-th
 computed generalized eigenvalue w and the corresponding exact
 eigenvalue lambda is
         chord(w, lambda) <=   EPS * norm(A, B) / S(I),
 where EPS is the machine precision.
 The reciprocal of the condition number of the right eigenvector u
 and left eigenvector v corresponding to the generalized eigenvalue w
 is defined as follows. Suppose
                  (A, B) = ( a   *  ) ( b  *  )  1
                           ( 0  A22 ),( 0 B22 )  n-1
                             1  n-1     1 n-1
 Then the reciprocal condition number DIF(I) is
         Difl[(a, b), (A22, B22)]  = sigma-min( Zl )
 where sigma-min(Zl) denotes the smallest singular value of
        Zl = [ kron(a, In-1) -kron(1, A22) ]
             [ kron(b, In-1) -kron(1, B22) ].
 Here In-1 is the identity matrix of size n-1 and X**H is the conjugate
 transpose of X. kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the
 matrices X and Y.
 We approximate the smallest singular value of Zl with an upper
 bound. This is done by CLATDF.
 An approximate error bound for a computed eigenvector VL(i) or
 VR(i) is given by
                     EPS * norm(A, B) / DIF(i).
