   SLA_GERCOND estimates the Skeel condition number of op(A) * op2(C)
   where op2 is determined by CMODE as follows
   CMODE =  1    op2(C) = C
   CMODE =  0    op2(C) = I
   CMODE = -1    op2(C) = inv(C)
   The Skeel condition number cond(A) = norminf( |inv(A)||A| )
   is computed by computing scaling factors R such that
   diag(R)*A*op2(C) is row equilibrated and computing the standard
   infinity-norm condition number.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
    Specifies the form of the system of equations:
      = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
      = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
      = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate Transpose = Transpose)

         N is INTEGER
    The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
    matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
    On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] AF
         AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)

         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
    The pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
    as computed by SGETRF; row i of the matrix was interchanged
    with row IPIV(i).
\param[in] CMODE
         CMODE is INTEGER
