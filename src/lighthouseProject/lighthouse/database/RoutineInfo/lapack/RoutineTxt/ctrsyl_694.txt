CTRSYL solves the complex Sylvester matrix equation:
   op(A)*X + X*op(B) = scale*C or
   op(A)*X - X*op(B) = scale*C,
where op(A) = A or A**H, and A and B are both upper triangular. A is
M-by-M and B is N-by-N; the right hand side C and the solution X are
M-by-N; and scale is an output scale factor, set <= 1 to avoid
overflow in X.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANA
         TRANA is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the option op(A):
         = 'N': op(A) = A    (No transpose)
         = 'C': op(A) = A**H (Conjugate transpose)
\param[in] TRANB
         TRANB is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the option op(B):
         = 'N': op(B) = B    (No transpose)
         = 'C': op(B) = B**H (Conjugate transpose)
\param[in] ISGN
         ISGN is INTEGER
         Specifies the sign in the equation:
         = +1: solve op(A)*X + X*op(B) = scale*C
         = -1: solve op(A)*X - X*op(B) = scale*C
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A, and the number of rows in the
         matrices X and C. M >= 0.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix B, and the number of columns in the
         matrices X and C. N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,M)
         The upper triangular matrix A.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).
\param[in] B
         B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,N)
         The upper triangular matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] C
         C is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDC,N)
         On entry, the M-by-N right hand side matrix C.
         On exit, C is overwritten by the solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDC
         LDC is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >= max(1,M)
\param[out] SCALE
         SCALE is REAL
         The scale factor, scale, set <= 1 to avoid overflow in X.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         = 1: A and B have common or very close eigenvalues; perturbed
              values were used to solve the equation (but the matrices
              A and B are unchanged).
