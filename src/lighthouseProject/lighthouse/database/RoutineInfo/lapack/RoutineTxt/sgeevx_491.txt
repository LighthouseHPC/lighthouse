SGEEVX computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.
Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
SCALE, and ABNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for the eigenvalues
(RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the right
eigenvectors (RCONDV).
The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
                 A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)
where lambda(j) is its eigenvalue.
The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
              u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate-transpose of u(j).
The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
equal to 1 and largest component real.
Balancing a matrix means permuting the rows and columns to make it
more nearly upper triangular, and applying a diagonal similarity
transformation D * A * D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix, to
make its rows and columns closer in norm and the condition numbers
of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors smaller.  The computed
reciprocal condition numbers correspond to the balanced matrix.
Permuting rows and columns will not change the condition numbers
(in exact arithmetic) but diagonal scaling will.  For further
explanation of balancing, see section 4.10.2 of the LAPACK
Users' Guide.
Arguments:
\param[in] BALANC
         BALANC is CHARACTER*1
         Indicates how the input matrix should be diagonally scaled
         and/or permuted to improve the conditioning of its
         eigenvalues.
         = 'N': Do not diagonally scale or permute;
         = 'P': Perform permutations to make the matrix more nearly
                upper triangular. Do not diagonally scale;
         = 'S': Diagonally scale the matrix, i.e. replace A by
                D*A*D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix chosen
                to make the rows and columns of A more equal in
                norm. Do not permute;
         = 'B': Both diagonally scale and permute A.
         Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the matrix
         after balancing and/or permuting. Permuting does not change
         condition numbers (in exact arithmetic), but balancing does.
\param[in] JOBVL
         JOBVL is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': left eigenvectors of A are not computed;
         = 'V': left eigenvectors of A are computed.
         If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', JOBVL must = 'V'.
\param[in] JOBVR
         JOBVR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': right eigenvectors of A are not computed;
         = 'V': right eigenvectors of A are computed.
         If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', JOBVR must = 'V'.
\param[in] SENSE
         SENSE is CHARACTER*1
         Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
         = 'N': None are computed;
         = 'E': Computed for eigenvalues only;
         = 'V': Computed for right eigenvectors only;
         = 'B': Computed for eigenvalues and right eigenvectors.
         If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', both left and right eigenvectors
         must also be computed (JOBVL = 'V' and JOBVR = 'V').
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
         On exit, A has been overwritten.  If JOBVL = 'V' or
         JOBVR = 'V', A contains the real Schur form of the balanced
         version of the input matrix A.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WR
         WR is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] WI
         WI is REAL array, dimension (N)
         WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts,
         respectively, of the computed eigenvalues.  Complex
         conjugate pairs of eigenvalues will appear consecutively
         with the eigenvalue having the positive imaginary part
         first.
\param[out] VL
         VL is REAL array, dimension (LDVL,N)
         If JOBVL = 'V', the left eigenvectors u(j) are stored one
         after another in the columns of VL, in the same order
         as their eigenvalues.
         If JOBVL = 'N', VL is not referenced.
         If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then u(j) = VL(:,j),
         the j-th column of VL.
         If the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues form a complex
         conjugate pair, then u(j) = VL(:,j) + i*VL(:,j+1) and
         u(j+1) = VL(:,j) - i*VL(:,j+1).
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VL.  LDVL >= 1; if
         JOBVL = 'V', LDVL >= N.
\param[out] VR
         VR is REAL array, dimension (LDVR,N)
         If JOBVR = 'V', the right eigenvectors v(j) are stored one
         after another in the columns of VR, in the same order
         as their eigenvalues.
         If JOBVR = 'N', VR is not referenced.
         If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then v(j) = VR(:,j),
         the j-th column of VR.
         If the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues form a complex
         conjugate pair, then v(j) = VR(:,j) + i*VR(:,j+1) and
         v(j+1) = VR(:,j) - i*VR(:,j+1).
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VR.  LDVR >= 1, and if
         JOBVR = 'V', LDVR >= N.
\param[out] ILO
         ILO is INTEGER
\param[out] IHI
         IHI is INTEGER
         ILO and IHI are integer values determined when A was
         balanced.  The balanced A(i,j) = 0 if I > J and 
         J = 1,...,ILO-1 or I = IHI+1,...,N.
\param[out] SCALE
         SCALE is REAL array, dimension (N)
         Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied
         when balancing A.  If P(j) is the index of the row and column
         interchanged with row and column j, and D(j) is the scaling
         factor applied to row and column j, then
         SCALE(J) = P(J),    for J = 1,...,ILO-1
                  = D(J),    for J = ILO,...,IHI
                  = P(J)     for J = IHI+1,...,N.
         The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
         then 1 to ILO-1.
\param[out] ABNRM
         ABNRM is REAL
         The one-norm of the balanced matrix (the maximum
         of the sum of absolute values of elements of any column).
\param[out] RCONDE
         RCONDE is REAL array, dimension (N)
         RCONDE(j) is the reciprocal condition number of the j-th
         eigenvalue.
\param[out] RCONDV
         RCONDV is REAL array, dimension (N)
         RCONDV(j) is the reciprocal condition number of the j-th
         right eigenvector.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.   If SENSE = 'N' or 'E',
         LWORK >= max(1,2*N), and if JOBVL = 'V' or JOBVR = 'V',
         LWORK >= 3*N.  If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', LWORK >= N*(N+6).
         For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (2*N-2)
         If SENSE = 'N' or 'E', not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the QR algorithm failed to compute all the
               eigenvalues, and no eigenvectors or condition numbers
               have been computed; elements 1:ILO-1 and i+1:N of WR
               and WI contain eigenvalues which have converged.
