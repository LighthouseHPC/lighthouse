SPOTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
positive definite matrix A.
The factorization has the form
   A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
   A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
This is the block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
         N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
         leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
         triangular part of A is not referenced.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
               positive definite, and the factorization could not be
               completed.
