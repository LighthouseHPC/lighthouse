SPBTRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a symmetric
positive definite band matrix A using the Cholesky factorization
A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T computed by SPBTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangular factor stored in AB;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular factor stored in AB.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
         A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the band matrix A, stored in the
         first KD+1 rows of the array.  The j-th column of U or L is
         stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
         if UPLO ='U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = U(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO ='L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = L(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
\param[in,out] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, the solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
