ZPTSVX uses the factorization A = L*D*L**H to compute the solution
to a complex system of linear equations A*X = B, where A is an
N-by-N Hermitian positive definite tridiagonal matrix and X and B
are N-by-NRHS matrices.
Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
provided.
\par Description:
The following steps are performed:
1. If FACT = 'N', the matrix A is factored as A = L*D*L**H, where L
   is a unit lower bidiagonal matrix and D is diagonal.  The
   factorization can also be regarded as having the form
   A = U**H*D*U.
2. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
   then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
   form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
   A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
   precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
   still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
   described below.
3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
   of A.
4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
   matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
   for it.
Arguments:
\param[in] FACT
         FACT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix
         A is supplied on entry.
         = 'F':  On entry, DF and EF contain the factored form of A.
                 D, E, DF, and EF will not be modified.
         = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to DF and EF and
                 factored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix A.
\param[in] E
         E is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix A.
\param[in,out] DF
         DF is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         If FACT = 'F', then DF is an input argument and on entry
         contains the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D
         from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.
         If FACT = 'N', then DF is an output argument and on exit
         contains the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D
         from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.
\param[in,out] EF
         EF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         If FACT = 'F', then EF is an input argument and on entry
         contains the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit
         bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.
         If FACT = 'N', then EF is an output argument and on exit
         contains the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit
         bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.
\param[in] B
         B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] X
         X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The reciprocal condition number of the matrix A.  If RCOND
         is less than the machine precision (in particular, if
         RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working precision.
         This condition is indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in any
         element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
               <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
                      not positive definite, so the factorization
                      could not be completed, and the solution has not
                      been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
               = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                      precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                      to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                      solution and error bounds are computed because
                      there are a number of situations where the
                      computed solution can be more accurate than the
                      value of RCOND would suggest.
