DGTTRF computes an LU factorization of a real tridiagonal matrix A
using elimination with partial pivoting and row interchanges.
The factorization has the form
   A = L * U
where L is a product of permutation and unit lower bidiagonal
matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in only the main
diagonal and first two superdiagonals.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.
\param[in,out] DL
         DL is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, DL must contain the (n-1) sub-diagonal elements of
         A.
         On exit, DL is overwritten by the (n-1) multipliers that
         define the matrix L from the LU factorization of A.
\param[in,out] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         On entry, D must contain the diagonal elements of A.
         On exit, D is overwritten by the n diagonal elements of the
         upper triangular matrix U from the LU factorization of A.
\param[in,out] DU
         DU is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, DU must contain the (n-1) super-diagonal elements
         of A.
         On exit, DU is overwritten by the (n-1) elements of the first
         super-diagonal of U.
\param[out] DU2
         DU2 is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-2)
         On exit, DU2 is overwritten by the (n-2) elements of the
         second super-diagonal of U.
\param[out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
         interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
         i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
         required.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = k, U(k,k) is exactly zero. The factorization
               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
               singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
               to solve a system of equations.
