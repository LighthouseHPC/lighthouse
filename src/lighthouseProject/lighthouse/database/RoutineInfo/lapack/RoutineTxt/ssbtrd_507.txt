SSBTRD reduces a real symmetric band matrix A to symmetric
tridiagonal form T by an orthogonal similarity transformation:
Q**T * A * Q = T.
Arguments:
\param[in] VECT
         VECT is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not form Q;
         = 'V':  form Q;
         = 'U':  update a matrix X, by forming X*Q.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
\param[in,out] AB
         AB is REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
         matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
         j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
         On exit, the diagonal elements of AB are overwritten by the
         diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T; if KD > 0, the
         elements on the first superdiagonal (if UPLO = 'U') or the
         first subdiagonal (if UPLO = 'L') are overwritten by the
         off-diagonal elements of T; the rest of AB is overwritten by
         values generated during the reduction.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
\param[out] D
         D is REAL array, dimension (N)
         The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
\param[out] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
         E(i) = T(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U'; E(i) = T(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.
\param[in,out] Q
         Q is REAL array, dimension (LDQ,N)
         On entry, if VECT = 'U', then Q must contain an N-by-N
         matrix X; if VECT = 'N' or 'V', then Q need not be set.
         On exit:
         if VECT = 'V', Q contains the N-by-N orthogonal matrix Q;
         if VECT = 'U', Q contains the product X*Q;
         if VECT = 'N', the array Q is not referenced.
\param[in] LDQ
         LDQ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Q.
         LDQ >= 1, and LDQ >= N if VECT = 'V' or 'U'.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
