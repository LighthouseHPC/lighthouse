DGTTRS solves one of the systems of equations
   A*X = B  or  A**T*X = B,
with a tridiagonal matrix A using the LU factorization computed
by DGTTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form of the system of equations.
         = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
         = 'T':  A**T* X = B  (Transpose)
         = 'C':  A**T* X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] DL
         DL is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) multipliers that define the matrix L from the
         LU factorization of A.
\param[in] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix U from
         the LU factorization of A.
\param[in] DU
         DU is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) elements of the first super-diagonal of U.
\param[in] DU2
         DU2 is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-2)
         The (n-2) elements of the second super-diagonal of U.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
         interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
         i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
         required.
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the matrix of right hand side vectors B.
         On exit, B is overwritten by the solution vectors X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
