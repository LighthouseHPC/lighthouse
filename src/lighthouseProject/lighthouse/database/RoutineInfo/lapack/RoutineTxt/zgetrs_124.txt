ZGETRS solves a system of linear equations
   A * X = B,  A**T * X = B,  or  A**H * X = B
with a general N-by-N matrix A using the LU factorization computed
by ZGETRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form of the system of equations:
         = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
         = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
         = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
         as computed by ZGETRF.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices from ZGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
         matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[in,out] B
         B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, the solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
