DGEEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an
M-by-N matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the row
scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to make
the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with
elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have absolute value 1.
R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be between SMLNUM = smallest safe
number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use of these scaling
factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition number of A but
works well in practice.
Arguments:
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The M-by-N matrix whose equilibration factors are
         to be computed.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
\param[out] R
         R is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (M)
         If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, R contains the row scale factors
         for A.
\param[out] C
         C is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0,  C contains the column scale factors for A.
\param[out] ROWCND
         ROWCND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, ROWCND contains the ratio of the
         smallest R(i) to the largest R(i).  If ROWCND >= 0.1 and
         AMAX is neither too large nor too small, it is not worth
         scaling by R.
\param[out] COLCND
         COLCND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         If INFO = 0, COLCND contains the ratio of the smallest
         C(i) to the largest C(i).  If COLCND >= 0.1, it is not
         worth scaling by C.
\param[out] AMAX
         AMAX is DOUBLE PRECISION
         Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
         close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
         should be scaled.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i,  and i is
               <= M:  the i-th row of A is exactly zero
               >  M:  the (i-M)-th column of A is exactly zero
