SSBEVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
of a real symmetric band matrix A.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can
be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
indices for the desired eigenvalues.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] RANGE
         RANGE is CHARACTER*1
         = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found;
         = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
                will be found;
         = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
\param[in,out] AB
         AB is REAL array, dimension (LDAB, N)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
         matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
         j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
         On exit, AB is overwritten by values generated during the
         reduction to tridiagonal form.  If UPLO = 'U', the first
         superdiagonal and the diagonal of the tridiagonal matrix T
         are returned in rows KD and KD+1 of AB, and if UPLO = 'L',
         the diagonal and first subdiagonal of T are returned in the
         first two rows of AB.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD + 1.
\param[out] Q
         Q is REAL array, dimension (LDQ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', the N-by-N orthogonal matrix used in the
                        reduction to tridiagonal form.
         If JOBZ = 'N', the array Q is not referenced.
\param[in] LDQ
         LDQ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Q.  If JOBZ = 'V', then
         LDQ >= max(1,N).
\param[in] VL
         VL is REAL
\param[in] VU
         VU is REAL
         If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
         be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
\param[in] IL
         IL is INTEGER
\param[in] IU
         IU is INTEGER
         If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
         smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
         1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
\param[in] ABSTOL
         ABSTOL is REAL
         The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
         An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
         when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
         of width less than or equal to
                 ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
         where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
         or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
         where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
         by reducing AB to tridiagonal form.
         Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
         set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
         If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
         eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
         2*SLAMCH('S').
         See "Computing Small Singular Values of Bidiagonal Matrices
         with Guaranteed High Relative Accuracy," by Demmel and
         Kahan, LAPACK Working Note #3.
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
         If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
\param[out] W
         W is REAL array, dimension (N)
         The first M elements contain the selected eigenvalues in
         ascending order.
\param[out] Z
         Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
         contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
         corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
         column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
         If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
         contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
         index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
         Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
         supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
         is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (7*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (5*N)
\param[out] IFAIL
         IFAIL is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
         IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
         indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit.
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         > 0:  if INFO = i, then i eigenvectors failed to converge.
               Their indices are stored in array IFAIL.
