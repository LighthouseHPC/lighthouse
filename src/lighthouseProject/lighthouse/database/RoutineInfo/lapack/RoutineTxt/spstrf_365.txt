SPSTRF computes the Cholesky factorization with complete
pivoting of a real symmetric positive semidefinite matrix A.
The factorization has the form
   P**T * A * P = U**T * U ,  if UPLO = 'U',
   P**T * A * P = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular, and
P is stored as vector PIV.
This algorithm does not attempt to check that A is positive
semidefinite. This version of the algorithm calls level 3 BLAS.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
         symmetric matrix A is stored.
         = 'U':  Upper triangular
         = 'L':  Lower triangular
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
         n by n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
         leading n by n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
         triangular part of A is not referenced.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization as above.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] PIV
         PIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         PIV is such that the nonzero entries are P( PIV(K), K ) = 1.
\param[out] RANK
         RANK is INTEGER
         The rank of A given by the number of steps the algorithm
         completed.
\param[in] TOL
         TOL is REAL
         User defined tolerance. If TOL < 0, then N*U*MAX( A(K,K) )
         will be used. The algorithm terminates at the (K-1)st step
         if the pivot <= TOL.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (2*N)
         Work space.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         < 0: If INFO = -K, the K-th argument had an illegal value,
         = 0: algorithm completed successfully, and
         > 0: the matrix A is either rank deficient with computed rank
              as returned in RANK, or is indefinite.  See Section 7 of
              LAPACK Working Note #161 for further information.
