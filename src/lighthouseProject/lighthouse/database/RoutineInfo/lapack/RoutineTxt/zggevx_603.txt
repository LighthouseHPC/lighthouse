ZGGEVX computes for a pair of N-by-N complex nonsymmetric matrices
(A,B) the generalized eigenvalues, and optionally, the left and/or
right generalized eigenvectors.
Optionally, it also computes a balancing transformation to improve
the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
LSCALE, RSCALE, ABNRM, and BBNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for
the eigenvalues (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the
right eigenvectors (RCONDV).
A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar
lambda or a ratio alpha/beta = lambda, such that A - lambda*B is
singular. It is usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as
there is a reasonable interpretation for beta=0, and even for both
being zero.
The right eigenvector v(j) corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda(j)
of (A,B) satisfies
                 A * v(j) = lambda(j) * B * v(j) .
The left eigenvector u(j) corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda(j)
of (A,B) satisfies
                 u(j)**H * A  = lambda(j) * u(j)**H * B.
where u(j)**H is the conjugate-transpose of u(j).
Arguments:
\param[in] BALANC
         BALANC is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the balance option to be performed:
         = 'N':  do not diagonally scale or permute;
         = 'P':  permute only;
         = 'S':  scale only;
         = 'B':  both permute and scale.
         Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the
         matrices after permuting and/or balancing. Permuting does
         not change condition numbers (in exact arithmetic), but
         balancing does.
\param[in] JOBVL
         JOBVL is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the left generalized eigenvectors;
         = 'V':  compute the left generalized eigenvectors.
\param[in] JOBVR
         JOBVR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the right generalized eigenvectors;
         = 'V':  compute the right generalized eigenvectors.
\param[in] SENSE
         SENSE is CHARACTER*1
         Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
         = 'N': none are computed;
         = 'E': computed for eigenvalues only;
         = 'V': computed for eigenvectors only;
         = 'B': computed for eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A, B, VL, and VR.  N >= 0.

         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the matrix A in the pair (A,B).
         On exit, A has been overwritten. If JOBVL='V' or JOBVR='V'
         or both, then A contains the first part of the complex Schur
         form of the "balanced" versions of the input A and B.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B

         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

\param[out] BETA
         BETA is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
         On exit, ALPHA(j)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will be the generalized
         eigenvalues.
         Note: the quotient ALPHA(j)/BETA(j) ) may easily over- or
         underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.  Thus, the user
         should avoid naively computing the ratio ALPHA/BETA.
         However, ALPHA will be always less than and usually
         comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and BETA always less
         than and usually comparable with norm(B).

         VL is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDVL,N)
         If JOBVL = 'V', the left generalized eigenvectors u(j) are
         stored one after another in the columns of VL, in the same
         order as their eigenvalues.
         Each eigenvector will be scaled so the largest component

         Each eigenvector will be scaled so the largest component
         will have abs(real part) + abs(imag. part) = 1.
         Not referenced if JOBVR = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER

         IHI is INTEGER
         ILO and IHI are integer values such that on exit

         factor applied to row j, then
           LSCALE(j) = PL(j)  for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                     = DL(j)  for j = ILO,...,IHI
                     = PL(j)  for j = IHI+1,...,N.
         The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
         then 1 to ILO-1.
\param[out] RSCALE
         RSCALE is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied
         to the right side of A and B.  If PR(j) is the index of the
         column interchanged with column j, and DR(j) is the scaling

           RSCALE(j) = PR(j)  for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                     = DR(j)  for j = ILO,...,IHI

         If JOB = 'V' or 'B', the estimated reciprocal condition
         numbers of the eigenvectors, stored in consecutive elements
         of the array. If the eigenvalues cannot be reordered to
         compute RCONDV(j), RCONDV(j) is set to 0; this can only occur
         when the true value would be very small anyway.
         If SENSE = 'N' or 'E', RCONDV is not referenced.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK

         The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,2*N).
         If SENSE = 'E', LWORK >= max(1,4*N).
         If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', LWORK >= max(1,2*N*N+2*N).
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (lrwork)
         lrwork must be at least max(1,6*N) if BALANC = 'S' or 'B',

         If SENSE = 'E', IWORK is not referenced.

         BWORK is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         If SENSE = 'N', BWORK is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         = 1,...,N:
               The QZ iteration failed.  No eigenvectors have been
               calculated, but ALPHA(j) and BETA(j) should be correct
               for j=INFO+1,...,N.
         > N:  =N+1: other than QZ iteration failed in ZHGEQZ.
               =N+2: error return from ZTGEVC.

\par Further Details:
 Balancing a matrix pair (A,B) includes, first, permuting rows and
 columns to isolate eigenvalues, second, applying diagonal similarity
 transformation to the rows and columns to make the rows and columns
 as close in norm as possible. The computed reciprocal condition
 numbers correspond to the balanced matrix. Permuting rows and columns
 will not change the condition numbers (in exact arithmetic) but
 diagonal scaling will.  For further explanation of balancing, see
 section 4.11.1.2 of LAPACK Users' Guide.
 An approximate error bound on the chordal distance between the i-th
 computed generalized eigenvalue w and the corresponding exact
 eigenvalue lambda is
      chord(w, lambda) <= EPS * norm(ABNRM, BBNRM) / RCONDE(I)
 An approximate error bound for the angle between the i-th computed
 eigenvector VL(i) or VR(i) is given by
      EPS * norm(ABNRM, BBNRM) / DIF(i).
 For further explanation of the reciprocal condition numbers RCONDE
 and RCONDV, see section 4.11 of LAPACK User's Guide.
