SSYTRF computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A using
the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method.  The form of the
factorization is
   A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T
where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with 
1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
         N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
         leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
         triangular part of A is not referenced.
         On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
         to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
         If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
         If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
         columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
         is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
         IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The length of WORK.  LWORK >=1.  For best performance
         LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned by ILAENV.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
               has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
               exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
               is used to solve a system of equations.

 If UPLO = 'U', then A = U*D*U**T, where
    U = P(n)*U(n)* ... *P(k)U(k)* ...,
 i.e., U is a product of terms P(k)*U(k), where k decreases from n to
 1 in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
 defined by IPIV(k), and U(k) is a unit upper triangular matrix, such
 that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then
            (   I    v    0   )   k-s
    U(k) =  (   0    I    0   )   s
            (   0    0    I   )   n-k
               k-s   s   n-k
 If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-1,k).
 If s = 2, the upper triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k-1,k-1), A(k-1,k),
 and A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-2,k-1:k).
 If UPLO = 'L', then A = L*D*L**T, where
    L = P(1)*L(1)* ... *P(k)*L(k)* ...,
 i.e., L is a product of terms P(k)*L(k), where k increases from 1 to
 n in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
 defined by IPIV(k), and L(k) is a unit lower triangular matrix, such
 that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then
            (   I    0     0   )  k-1
    L(k) =  (   0    I     0   )  s
            (   0    v     I   )  n-k-s+1
               k-1   s  n-k-s+1
 If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(k+1:n,k).
 If s = 2, the lower triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k,k), A(k+1,k),
 and A(k+1,k+1), and v overwrites A(k+2:n,k:k+1).
