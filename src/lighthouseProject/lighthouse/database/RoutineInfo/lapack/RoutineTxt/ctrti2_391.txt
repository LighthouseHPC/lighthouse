CTRTI2 computes the inverse of a complex upper or lower triangular
matrix.
This is the Level 2 BLAS version of the algorithm.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the matrix A is upper or lower triangular.
         = 'U':  Upper triangular
         = 'L':  Lower triangular
\param[in] DIAG
         DIAG is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not the matrix A is unit triangular.
         = 'N':  Non-unit triangular
         = 'U':  Unit triangular
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
         leading n by n upper triangular part of the array A contains
         the upper triangular matrix, and the strictly lower
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
         leading n by n lower triangular part of the array A contains
         the lower triangular matrix, and the strictly upper
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the
         diagonal elements of A are also not referenced and are
         assumed to be 1.
         On exit, the (triangular) inverse of the original matrix, in
         the same storage format.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
