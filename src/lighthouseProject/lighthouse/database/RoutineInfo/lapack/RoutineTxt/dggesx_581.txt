DGGESX computes for a pair of N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrices
(A,B), the generalized eigenvalues, the real Schur form (S,T), and,
optionally, the left and/or right matrices of Schur vectors (VSL and
VSR).  This gives the generalized Schur factorization
     (A,B) = ( (VSL) S (VSR)**T, (VSL) T (VSR)**T )
Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues so that a selected cluster
of eigenvalues appears in the leading diagonal blocks of the upper
quasi-triangular matrix S and the upper triangular matrix T; computes
a reciprocal condition number for the average of the selected
eigenvalues (RCONDE); and computes a reciprocal condition number for
the right and left deflating subspaces corresponding to the selected
eigenvalues (RCONDV). The leading columns of VSL and VSR then form
an orthonormal basis for the corresponding left and right eigenspaces
(deflating subspaces).
A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar w
or a ratio alpha/beta = w, such that  A - w*B is singular.  It is
usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as there is a
reasonable interpretation for beta=0 or for both being zero.
A pair of matrices (S,T) is in generalized real Schur form if T is
upper triangular with non-negative diagonal and S is block upper
triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 blocks.  1-by-1 blocks correspond
to real generalized eigenvalues, while 2-by-2 blocks of S will be
"standardized" by making the corresponding elements of T have the
form:
        [  a  0  ]
        [  0  b  ]
and the pair of corresponding 2-by-2 blocks in S and T will have a
complex conjugate pair of generalized eigenvalues.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBVSL
         JOBVSL is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the left Schur vectors;
         = 'V':  compute the left Schur vectors.
\param[in] JOBVSR
         JOBVSR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the right Schur vectors;
         = 'V':  compute the right Schur vectors.
\param[in] SORT
         SORT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not to order the eigenvalues on the
         diagonal of the generalized Schur form.
         = 'N':  Eigenvalues are not ordered;
         = 'S':  Eigenvalues are ordered (see SELCTG).
\param[in] SELCTG
         SELCTG is procedure) LOGICAL FUNCTION of three DOUBLE PRECISION arguments
         SELCTG must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling subroutine.
         If SORT = 'N', SELCTG is not referenced.
         If SORT = 'S', SELCTG is used to select eigenvalues to sort
         to the top left of the Schur form.
         An eigenvalue (ALPHAR(j)+ALPHAI(j))/BETA(j) is selected if
         SELCTG(ALPHAR(j),ALPHAI(j),BETA(j)) is true; i.e. if either
         one of a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues is selected,
         then both complex eigenvalues are selected.
         Note that a selected complex eigenvalue may no longer satisfy
         SELCTG(ALPHAR(j),ALPHAI(j),BETA(j)) = .TRUE. after ordering,
         since ordering may change the value of complex eigenvalues
         (especially if the eigenvalue is ill-conditioned), in this
         case INFO is set to N+3.
\param[in] SENSE
         SENSE is CHARACTER*1
         Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
         = 'N' : None are computed;
         = 'E' : Computed for average of selected eigenvalues only;
         = 'V' : Computed for selected deflating subspaces only;
         = 'B' : Computed for both.
         If SENSE = 'E', 'V', or 'B', SORT must equal 'S'.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A, B, VSL, and VSR.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the first of the pair of matrices.
         On exit, A has been overwritten by its generalized Schur
         form S.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB, N)
         On entry, the second of the pair of matrices.
         On exit, B has been overwritten by its generalized Schur
         form T.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] SDIM
         SDIM is INTEGER
         If SORT = 'N', SDIM = 0.
         If SORT = 'S', SDIM = number of eigenvalues (after sorting)
         for which SELCTG is true.  (Complex conjugate pairs for which
         SELCTG is true for either eigenvalue count as 2.)
\param[out] ALPHAR
         ALPHAR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] ALPHAI
         ALPHAI is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] BETA
         BETA is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         On exit, (ALPHAR(j) + ALPHAI(j)*i)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will
         be the generalized eigenvalues.  ALPHAR(j) + ALPHAI(j)*i
         and BETA(j),j=1,...,N  are the diagonals of the complex Schur
         form (S,T) that would result if the 2-by-2 diagonal blocks of
         the real Schur form of (A,B) were further reduced to
         triangular form using 2-by-2 complex unitary transformations.
         If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then the j-th eigenvalue is real; if
         positive, then the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues are a
         complex conjugate pair, with ALPHAI(j+1) negative.
         Note: the quotients ALPHAR(j)/BETA(j) and ALPHAI(j)/BETA(j)
         may easily over- or underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.
         Thus, the user should avoid naively computing the ratio.
         However, ALPHAR and ALPHAI will be always less than and
         usually comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and BETA always
         less than and usually comparable with norm(B).
\param[out] VSL
         VSL is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVSL,N)
         If JOBVSL = 'V', VSL will contain the left Schur vectors.
         Not referenced if JOBVSL = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVSL
         LDVSL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VSL. LDVSL >=1, and
         if JOBVSL = 'V', LDVSL >= N.
\param[out] VSR
         VSR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVSR,N)
         If JOBVSR = 'V', VSR will contain the right Schur vectors.
         Not referenced if JOBVSR = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVSR
         LDVSR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VSR. LDVSR >= 1, and
         if JOBVSR = 'V', LDVSR >= N.
\param[out] RCONDE
         RCONDE is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( 2 )
         If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', RCONDE(1) and RCONDE(2) contain the
         reciprocal condition numbers for the average of the selected
         eigenvalues.
         Not referenced if SENSE = 'N' or 'V'.
\param[out] RCONDV
         RCONDV is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( 2 )
         If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', RCONDV(1) and RCONDV(2) contain the
         reciprocal condition numbers for the selected deflating
         subspaces.
         Not referenced if SENSE = 'N' or 'E'.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.
         If N = 0, LWORK >= 1, else if SENSE = 'E', 'V', or 'B',
         LWORK >= max( 8*N, 6*N+16, 2*SDIM*(N-SDIM) ), else
         LWORK >= max( 8*N, 6*N+16 ).
         Note that 2*SDIM*(N-SDIM) <= N*N/2.
         Note also that an error is only returned if
         LWORK < max( 8*N, 6*N+16), but if SENSE = 'E' or 'V' or 'B'
         this may not be large enough.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the bound on the optimal size of the WORK
         array and the minimum size of the IWORK array, returns these
         values as the first entries of the WORK and IWORK arrays, and
         no error message related to LWORK or LIWORK is issued by
         XERBLA.
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the minimum LIWORK.
\param[in] LIWORK
         LIWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array IWORK.
         If SENSE = 'N' or N = 0, LIWORK >= 1, otherwise
         LIWORK >= N+6.
         If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
         routine only calculates the bound on the optimal size of the
         WORK array and the minimum size of the IWORK array, returns
         these values as the first entries of the WORK and IWORK
         arrays, and no error message related to LWORK or LIWORK is
         issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] BWORK
         BWORK is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         Not referenced if SORT = 'N'.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         = 1,...,N:
               The QZ iteration failed.  (A,B) are not in Schur
               form, but ALPHAR(j), ALPHAI(j), and BETA(j) should
               be correct for j=INFO+1,...,N.
         > N:  =N+1: other than QZ iteration failed in DHGEQZ
               =N+2: after reordering, roundoff changed values of
                     some complex eigenvalues so that leading
                     eigenvalues in the Generalized Schur form no
                     longer satisfy SELCTG=.TRUE.  This could also
                     be caused due to scaling.
               =N+3: reordering failed in DTGSEN.
