SSPGVD computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A and
B are assumed to be symmetric, stored in packed format, and B is also
positive definite.
If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.
The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
without guard digits, but we know of none.
Arguments:
\param[in] ITYPE
         ITYPE is INTEGER
         Specifies the problem type to be solved:
         = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x
         = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x
         = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the contents of AP are destroyed.
\param[in,out] BP
         BP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
         B, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of B
         is stored in the array BP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', BP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = B(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', BP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = B(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization B = U**T*U or B = L*L**T, in the same storage
         format as B.
\param[out] W
         W is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] Z
         Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the matrix Z of
         eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
         if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**T*B*Z = I;
         if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the required LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.
         If N <= 1,               LWORK >= 1.
         If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LWORK >= 2*N.
         If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK >= 1 + 6*N + 2*N**2.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the required sizes of the WORK and IWORK
         arrays, returns these values as the first entries of the WORK
         and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to LWORK or
         LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the required LIWORK.
\param[in] LIWORK
         LIWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array IWORK.
         If JOBZ  = 'N' or N <= 1, LIWORK >= 1.
         If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LIWORK >= 3 + 5*N.
         If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
         routine only calculates the required sizes of the WORK and
         IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
         the WORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to
         LWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  SPPTRF or SSPEVD returned an error code:
            <= N:  if INFO = i, SSPEVD failed to converge;
                   i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
                   tridiagonal form did not converge to zero;
            > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= N, then the leading
                   minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
                   The factorization of B could not be completed and
                   no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
