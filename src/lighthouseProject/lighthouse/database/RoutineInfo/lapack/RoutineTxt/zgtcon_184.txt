ZGTCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex
tridiagonal matrix A using the LU factorization as computed by
ZGTTRF.
An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
Arguments:
\param[in] NORM
         NORM is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
         infinity-norm condition number is required:
         = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
         = 'I':         Infinity-norm.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] DL
         DL is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) multipliers that define the matrix L from the
         LU factorization of A as computed by ZGTTRF.
\param[in] D
         D is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix U from
         the LU factorization of A.
\param[in] DU
         DU is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) elements of the first superdiagonal of U.
\param[in] DU2
         DU2 is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-2)
         The (n-2) elements of the second superdiagonal of U.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
         interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
         i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
         required.
\param[in] ANORM
         ANORM is DOUBLE PRECISION
         If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A.
         If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
         estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
