SGEEV computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.
The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
                 A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)
where lambda(j) is its eigenvalue.
The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
              u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate-transpose of u(j).
The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
equal to 1 and largest component real.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBVL
         JOBVL is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': left eigenvectors of A are not computed;
         = 'V': left eigenvectors of A are computed.
\param[in] JOBVR
         JOBVR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': right eigenvectors of A are not computed;
         = 'V': right eigenvectors of A are computed.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
         On exit, A has been overwritten.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WR
         WR is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] WI
         WI is REAL array, dimension (N)
         WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts,
         respectively, of the computed eigenvalues.  Complex
         conjugate pairs of eigenvalues appear consecutively
         with the eigenvalue having the positive imaginary part
         first.
\param[out] VL
         VL is REAL array, dimension (LDVL,N)
         If JOBVL = 'V', the left eigenvectors u(j) are stored one
         after another in the columns of VL, in the same order
         as their eigenvalues.
         If JOBVL = 'N', VL is not referenced.
         If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then u(j) = VL(:,j),
         the j-th column of VL.
         If the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues form a complex
         conjugate pair, then u(j) = VL(:,j) + i*VL(:,j+1) and
         u(j+1) = VL(:,j) - i*VL(:,j+1).
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VL.  LDVL >= 1; if
         JOBVL = 'V', LDVL >= N.
\param[out] VR
         VR is REAL array, dimension (LDVR,N)
         If JOBVR = 'V', the right eigenvectors v(j) are stored one
         after another in the columns of VR, in the same order
         as their eigenvalues.
         If JOBVR = 'N', VR is not referenced.
         If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then v(j) = VR(:,j),
         the j-th column of VR.
         If the j-th and (j+1)-st eigenvalues form a complex
         conjugate pair, then v(j) = VR(:,j) + i*VR(:,j+1) and
         v(j+1) = VR(:,j) - i*VR(:,j+1).
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VR.  LDVR >= 1; if
         JOBVR = 'V', LDVR >= N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,3*N), and
         if JOBVL = 'V' or JOBVR = 'V', LWORK >= 4*N.  For good
         performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the QR algorithm failed to compute all the
               eigenvalues, and no eigenvectors have been computed;
               elements i+1:N of WR and WI contain eigenvalues which
               have converged.
