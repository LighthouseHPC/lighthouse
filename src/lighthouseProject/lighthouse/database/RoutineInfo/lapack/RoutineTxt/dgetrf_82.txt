DGETRF computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
The factorization has the form
   A = P * L * U
where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m > n), and U is upper
triangular (upper trapezoidal if m < n).
This is the right-looking Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.
Arguments:
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the M-by-N matrix to be factored.
         On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
         A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
\param[out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
         The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
         matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
               singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
               to solve a system of equations.
