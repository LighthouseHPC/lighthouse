CPBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite band matrix using
the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by
CPBTRF.
An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangular factor stored in AB;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular factor stored in AB.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of sub-diagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
         A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the band matrix A, stored in the
         first KD+1 rows of the array.  The j-th column of U or L is
         stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
         if UPLO ='U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = U(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO ='L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = L(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
\param[in] ANORM
         ANORM is REAL
         The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the Hermitian band matrix A.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is REAL
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
         estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
