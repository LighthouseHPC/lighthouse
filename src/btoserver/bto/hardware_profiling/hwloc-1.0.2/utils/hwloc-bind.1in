.SH DESCRIPTION
.
hwloc-bind execs an executable (with optional command line arguments)
that is bound to the specified location (or list of locations).  Upon
successful execution, hwloc-bind simply sets bindings and then execs
the executable over itself.
.
.PP
.B NOTE:
It is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page
before reading this man page.  Most of the concepts described in
hwloc(7) directly apply to the hwloc-bind utility.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
hwloc-bind's operation is best described through several examples.
.
.PP
To run the echo command on the first logical processor of the second
socket:

    hwloc-bind socket:1.pu:0 -- echo hello

which is exactly equivalent to

    hwloc-bind socket:1.pu:0 echo hello

To bind the "echo" command to the first core of the second socket and
the second core of the first socket:

    hwloc-bind socket:1.core:0 socket:0.core:1 echo hello

Note that binding the "echo" command to multiple processors is
probably meaningless (because "echo" is likely implemented as a
single-threaded application); these examples just serve to show what
hwloc-bind can do.
.
.PP
To run on the three first sockets on the second and third nodes:

    hwloc-bind node:1-2.socket:0:3 echo hello

To run on processor with physical index 2 in socket with physical index 1:

    hwloc-bind --physical socket:1.core:2 echo hello

To run on odd cores within even sockets:

    hwloc-bind socket:even.core:odd echo hello

To run on the first socket, except on its second and fifth cores:

    hwloc-bind socket:0 ~socket:0.core:1 ~socket:0.core:4 echo hello

The --get option can report current bindings.  This example shows
nesting hwloc-bind invocations to set a binding and then report it:

    hwloc-bind node:1.socket:2 hwloc-bind --get

On one of the hwloc developer's machines, this example
.
reports "0x00004444,0x44000000".  The mask reported on your machine
may be different.
.
.PP
Locations may also be specified as a hex bit mask (typically generated
by hwloc-calc).  For example:

    hwloc-bind 0x00004444,0x44000000 echo hello
    hwloc-bind `hwloc-calc node:1.socket:2` echo hello
.
.\" **************************
.\"    Return value section
.\" **************************
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful execution, hwloc-bind execs the command over itself.
The return value is therefore whatever the return value of the command
is.
.
.PP
hwloc-bind will return nonzero if any kind of error occurs, such as
(but not limited to): failure to parse the command line, failure to
retrieve process bindings, or lack of a command to execute.
