This directory contains some helpers for running dojango on appengine.

memcache_zipserve.py:

  Part of http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-samples/: 
  Using zipserve to serve the media-files. After the first use they'll be 
  cached in memcache. Modified to support last-modified-headers (so we have 
  a real CDN!)

dojo_serve.py:
  
  Helper for serving the whole dojo release folder, that holds the dojo
  modules as zipfiles.
  It can be used within app.yaml (AppEngine configuration file) like this:

      - url: /dojango/media/release/.*
        script: dojango/appengine/dojo_serve.py

  Afterwards all zip-files within /dojango/media/release/DOJANGO_DOJO_VERSION/
  will be served and cached.
