            The condition number of a system of linear equations <span lang="latex">Ax=b</span> measures the stability
            to numerical operations. A system of equations is considered to be well-conditioned/ill-conditioned if a
            slight perturbation in the coefficient matrix <span lang="latex">A</span> or in the vector <span lang="latex">b</span>
            results in a small/great change in the solution vector <span lang="latex">x</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In mathematical terms, if <span lang="latex">x + \delta x</span> is the solution to a perturbed problem, then
            <pre>
                <span lang="latex">(A + \delta A)(x + \delta x) = b + \delta b</span>,
            </pre>
            and
            <pre>
                <span lang="latex">\frac{ \parallel \delta x \parallel}{ \parallel x \parallel}
                \leq
                \kappa(A)
                \left(\frac{ \parallel \delta A \parallel}{ \parallel A \parallel} +
                \frac{ \parallel \delta b \parallel}{ \parallel b \parallel} \right) + ...
                </span>
            </pre>           
            <span lang="latex">\kappa(A)</span> is the condition number of a square matrix <span lang="latex">A</span>,
            which is defined as:
            <pre>
                <span lang="latex">\kappa(A) = \parallel A \parallel \parallel A^{-1} \parallel</span>,
            </pre>
            where <span lang="latex">\parallel A \parallel</span> is the norm of matrix <span lang="latex">A</span>.
        </p>
       <p>
            Condition numbers near one indicate well-conditioned matrices, whereas 
            condition numbers much greater than one imply ill-conditioned matrices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The condition estimation routines in LAPACK compute the reciprocal condition number, which is defined as:
            <pre>
                <span lang="latex">RCOND = 1/\kappa(A)</span>.
            </pre>
            Computing <span lang="latex">\parallel A \parallel</span> directly can be expensive. Therefore, it is estimated
            by methods of low cost. <i>RCOND</i> is zero or a minimal number on the order of the machine epsilon (or machine precision)
            if <span lang="latex">A^{-1}</span> does not exist (i.e., <span lang="latex">A</span> is singular).
        </p>
        <p>
            Condition number, or its reciprocal <i>RCOND</i>, is an indicator one can examine before computing the solution
            to a system of linear equations.
