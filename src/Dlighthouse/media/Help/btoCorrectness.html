            Enable correctness testing. Correctness testing is disabled by default.
            Enabling requires a BLAS library (libblas) on BTO-executing server.
            When enabled, the input program is converted to a set of very naive BLAS calls which BTO
            results are compared to. This requires having and working BLAS with cblas entry points.
        </p><p>
            N.B. <b>For best results, setting the testing size parameters is recommended if correctness testing is enabled.</b>
            It is specified as 3000:3000:1 by default. See section <i>Testing Size</i> for more info.
        </p><p>
            When the correctness tester is turned on, it analyzes the same subset as the (default) empirical tester.
            This can be modified using the <i>Threshold</i> setting.
