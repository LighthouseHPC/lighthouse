            Matrix factorization (or matrix decomposition) is a product of an input matrix <span lang="latex">A</span> so that
            <pre>
                <span lang="latex">A = F_1F_2...F_k</span>.
            </pre>
            Matrix factorization is a base technique for implementing matrix algorithms, including solving a system of linear
            equations. In LAPACK, routines that perform matrix factoring are in the form of <i>xyyTRF</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The method of the factorization depends on the properties of the matrix <span lang="latex">A</span>.
            The main types of factorizations in LAPACK for solving a system of linear equations are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>LU</i> decomposition: <span lang="latex">A=LU</span>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Related <i>LU</i> decomposition: <span lang="latex">A=PLU</span>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cholesky decomposition: <span lang="latex">A=U^TU (A=U^HU)</span>
                    or <span lang="latex">A=LL^T (A=LL^H)</span>, 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alternative Cholesky decomposition: <span lang="latex">A=UPU^T (A=UPU^H)</span> or
                    <span lang="latex">A=LPL^T (A=LPL^H)</span>,
                </li>
            </ul>
            whiere <span lang="latex">L</span> is lower triangular, <span lang="latex">U</span> is upper triangular, and <span lang="latex">P</span> is a permutation matrix.
