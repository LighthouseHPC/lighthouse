            The task is to solve a system of simultaneous linear equations: 
            <pre>
                    <i>Ax = b</i>,
            </pre>
            where <i>A</i> is the coefficient matrix, <i>b</i> is the right-hand side, and <i>x</i> is the solution.
            If there are several right hand sides, then 
            <pre>
                    <i>AX = B</i>,  
            </pre>
            where the columns of <i>B</i> are the individual right-hand sides, and the columns of <i>X</i> are the corresponding solutions.  
        </p>

            Two types of routines, Driver and Computational, are provided for solving systems of linear equation, including in the forms of
            <i>A<sup>T</sup>X=B</i> and <i>A<sup>H</sup>X=B</i>.
