            The task is to solve a system of simultaneous linear equations: 
            <pre>
                    <span lang="latex">Ax = b</span>,
            </pre>
            where <span lang="latex">A</span> is the coefficient matrix, <span lang="latex">b</span> is the right-hand side,
            and <span lang="latex">x</span> is the solution. If there are several right-hand sides, then 
            <pre>
                    <span lang="latex">AX = B</span>,  
            </pre>
            where the columns of <span lang="latex">B</span> are the individual right-hand sides, and the columns of
            <span lang="latex">X</span> are the corresponding solutions.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Two types of routines, Driver and Computational, are provided for solving systems of linear equation, including in the forms of
            <span lang="latex">A^TX=B</span> and <span lang="latex">A^HX=B</span>.
