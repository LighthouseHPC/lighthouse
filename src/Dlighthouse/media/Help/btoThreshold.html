            This parameter controls what portion of versions produced are tested by the
            empirical (default) or correctness tester. When the correctness tester is turned on,
            it analyzes the same subset as the empirical tester. The default is 0.01 --
            the versions predicted to be within 1% of the performance of the best predicted version.
