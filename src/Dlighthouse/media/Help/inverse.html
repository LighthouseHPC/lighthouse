            The inverse of a square matrix <span lang="latex">A</span>, denoted by <span lang="latex">A^{-1}</span>,
            is the matrix so that <span lang="latex">AA^{-1} = I</span>, where <span lang="latex">I</span> is the
            Identity matrix.
        </p>

            The LAPACK routines that compute matrix inverses are in the form of xyyTRI, categorized into the
            <i>Computational</i> routines. The matrix inverse routines require factoriztion (LU, Cholesky, etc.) and
            more operations than the solve routines, and they may demand extra workspace.
