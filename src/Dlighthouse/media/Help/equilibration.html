            The performance of solving a system of linear equations depends on the condition number of the coefficient matrix.
            Therefore, condition number or its reciprocal <i>RCOND</i>, is an indicator one can examine before computing the solution.
            If the the value of <i>RCOND</i> is less than the machine epsilon, it indicates that the system is too
            ill-conditioned to obtain a meaningful solution.

            Scaling can substantially reduce the condition number of a linear system. The procedure of scalling is known as
            <b>equilibration</b>.

            Scaling methods include row scaling, column scaling, and row-column scaling.
            LAPACK routines apply appropriate techniques for equilibrating matrices depending on the input data.
