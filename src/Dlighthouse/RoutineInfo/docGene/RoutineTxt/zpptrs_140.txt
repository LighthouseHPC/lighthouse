ZPPTRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a Hermitian
positive definite matrix A in packed storage using the Cholesky
factorization A = U**H * U or A = L * L**H computed by ZPPTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] AP
         AP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
         A = U**H * U or A = L * L**H, packed columnwise in a linear
         array.  The j-th column of U or L is stored in the array AP
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = U(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = L(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
\param[in,out] B
         B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, the solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
