SPFTRI computes the inverse of a real (symmetric) positive definite
matrix A using the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T
computed by SPFTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANSR
         TRANSR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  The Normal TRANSR of RFP A is stored;
         = 'T':  The Transpose TRANSR of RFP A is stored.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension ( N*(N+1)/2 )
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A in RFP format. RFP format is
         described by TRANSR, UPLO, and N as follows: If TRANSR = 'N'
         then RFP A is (0:N,0:k-1) when N is even; k=N/2. RFP A is
         (0:N-1,0:k) when N is odd; k=N/2. IF TRANSR = 'T' then RFP is
         the transpose of RFP A as defined when
         TRANSR = 'N'. The contents of RFP A are defined by UPLO as
         follows: If UPLO = 'U' the RFP A contains the nt elements of
         upper packed A. If UPLO = 'L' the RFP A contains the elements
         of lower packed A. The LDA of RFP A is (N+1)/2 when TRANSR =
         'T'. When TRANSR is 'N' the LDA is N+1 when N is even and N
         is odd. See the Note below for more details.
         On exit, the symmetric inverse of the original matrix, in the
         same storage format.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the (i,i) element of the factor U or L is
               zero, and the inverse could not be computed.
