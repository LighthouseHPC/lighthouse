DSYEQUB computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
symmetric matrix A and reduce its condition number
(with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale factors,
S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.  This
choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the
smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
scalings.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
         as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
         = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The N-by-N symmetric matrix whose scaling
         factors are to be computed.  Only the diagonal elements of A
         are referenced.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] S
         S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.
\param[out] SCOND
         SCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
         the largest S(i).  If SCOND >= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
         large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.
\param[out] AMAX
         AMAX is DOUBLE PRECISION
         Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
         close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
         should be scaled.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element is nonpositive.
