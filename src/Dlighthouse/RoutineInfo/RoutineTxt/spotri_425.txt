*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SPOTRI computes the inverse of a real symmetric positive definite
*  matrix A using the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T
*  computed by SPOTRF.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by
*          SPOTRF.
*          On exit, the upper or lower triangle of the (symmetric)
*          inverse of A, overwriting the input factor U or L.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the (i,i) element of the factor U or L is
*                zero, and the inverse could not be computed.
