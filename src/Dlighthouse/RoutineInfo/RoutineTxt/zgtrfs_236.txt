ZGTRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
equations when the coefficient matrix is tridiagonal, and provides
error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form of the system of equations:
         = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
         = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
         = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] DL
         DL is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of A.
\param[in] D
         D is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
         The diagonal elements of A.
\param[in] DU
         DU is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) superdiagonal elements of A.
\param[in] DLF
         DLF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) multipliers that define the matrix L from the
         LU factorization of A as computed by ZGTTRF.
\param[in] DF
         DF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix U from
         the LU factorization of A.
\param[in] DUF
         DUF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) elements of the first superdiagonal of U.
\param[in] DU2
         DU2 is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-2)
         The (n-2) elements of the second superdiagonal of U.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
         interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
         i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
         required.
\param[in] B
         B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] X
         X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by ZGTTRS.
         On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
         overestimate of the true error.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
\par Internal Parameters:
 ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
