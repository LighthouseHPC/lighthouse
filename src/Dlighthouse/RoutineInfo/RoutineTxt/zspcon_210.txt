  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> ZSPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the 1-norm) of a complex symmetric packed matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by ZSPTRF. An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
