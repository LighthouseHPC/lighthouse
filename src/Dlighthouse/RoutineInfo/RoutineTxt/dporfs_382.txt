*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPORFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
*  equations when the coefficient matrix is symmetric positive definite,
*  and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
*  solution.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
*          upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
*          of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
*          is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
*          triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
*          the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is
*          not referenced.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  AF      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
*          The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
*          A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by DPOTRF.
*
*  LDAF    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
*
*  B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          The right hand side matrix B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  X       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*          On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by DPOTRS.
*          On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
*  Internal Parameters
*  ===================
*
*  ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
