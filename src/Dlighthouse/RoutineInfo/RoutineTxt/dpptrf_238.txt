*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPPTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
*  positive definite matrix A stored in packed format.
*
*  The factorization has the form
*     A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*     A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
*          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
*          is stored in the array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*          See below for further details.
*
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the
*          Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, in the same
*          storage format as A.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
*                positive definite, and the factorization could not be
*                completed.
