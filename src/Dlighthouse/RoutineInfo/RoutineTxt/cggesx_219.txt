  CGGESX computes for a pair of N-by-N complex nonsymmetric matrices
  (A,B), the generalized eigenvalues, the complex Schur form (S,T),
  and, optionally, the left and/or right matrices of Schur vectors (VSL
  and VSR).  This gives the generalized Schur factorization

       (A,B) = ( (VSL) S (VSR)**H, (VSL) T (VSR)**H )

  where (VSR)**H is the conjugate-transpose of VSR.

  Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues so that a selected cluster
  of eigenvalues appears in the leading diagonal blocks of the upper
  triangular matrix S and the upper triangular matrix T; computes
  a reciprocal condition number for the average of the selected
  eigenvalues (RCONDE); and computes a reciprocal condition number for
  the right and left deflating subspaces corresponding to the selected
  eigenvalues (RCONDV). The leading columns of VSL and VSR then form
  an orthonormal basis for the corresponding left and right eigenspaces
  (deflating subspaces).

  A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar w
  or a ratio alpha/beta = w, such that  A - w*B is singular.  It is
  usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as there is a
  reasonable interpretation for beta=0 or for both being zero.

  A pair of matrices (S,T) is in generalized complex Schur form if T is
  upper triangular with non-negative diagonal and S is upper
  triangular.

  Arguments

  JOBVSL  (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  do not compute the left Schur vectors;
          = 'V':  compute the left Schur vectors.

  JOBVSR  (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  do not compute the right Schur vectors;
          = 'V':  compute the right Schur vectors.

  SORT    (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether or not to order the eigenvalues on the
          diagonal of the generalized Schur form.
          = 'N':  Eigenvalues are not ordered;
          = 'S':  Eigenvalues are ordered (see SELCTG).

  SELCTG  (external procedure) LOGICAL FUNCTION of two COMPLEX arguments
          SELCTG must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling subroutine.
          If SORT = 'N', SELCTG is not referenced.
          If SORT = 'S', SELCTG is used to select eigenvalues to sort
          to the top left of the Schur form.
          Note that a selected complex eigenvalue may no longer satisfy
          SELCTG(ALPHA(j),BETA(j)) = .TRUE. after ordering, since
          ordering may change the value of complex eigenvalues
          (especially if the eigenvalue is ill-conditioned), in this
          case INFO is set to N+3 see INFO below).

  SENSE   (input) CHARACTER*1
          Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
          = 'N' : None are computed;
          = 'E' : Computed for average of selected eigenvalues only;
          = 'V' : Computed for selected deflating subspaces only;
          = 'B' : Computed for both.
          If SENSE = 'E', 'V', or 'B', SORT must equal 'S'.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrices A, B, VSL, and VSR.  N >= 0.

  A       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA, N)
          On entry, the first of the pair of matrices.
          On exit, A has been overwritten by its generalized Schur
          form S.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

  B       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB, N)
          On entry, the second of the pair of matrices.
          On exit, B has been overwritten by its generalized Schur
          form T.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  SDIM    (output) INTEGER
          If SORT = 'N', SDIM = 0.
          If SORT = 'S', SDIM = number of eigenvalues (after sorting)
          for which SELCTG is true.

  ALPHA   (output) COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
  BETA    (output) COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
          On exit, ALPHA(j)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will be the
          generalized eigenvalues.  ALPHA(j) and BETA(j),j=1,...,N  are
          the diagonals of the complex Schur form (S,T).  BETA(j) will
          be non-negative real.

          Note: the quotients ALPHA(j)/BETA(j) may easily over- or
          underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.  Thus, the user
          should avoid naively computing the ratio alpha/beta.
          However, ALPHA will be always less than and usually
          comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and BETA always less
          than and usually comparable with norm(B).

  VSL     (output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVSL,N)
          If JOBVSL = 'V', VSL will contain the left Schur vectors.
          Not referenced if JOBVSL = 'N'.

  LDVSL   (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the matrix VSL. LDVSL >=1, and
          if JOBVSL = 'V', LDVSL >= N.

  VSR     (output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVSR,N)
          If JOBVSR = 'V', VSR will contain the right Schur vectors.
          Not referenced if JOBVSR = 'N'.

  LDVSR   (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the matrix VSR. LDVSR >= 1, and
          if JOBVSR = 'V', LDVSR >= N.

  RCONDE  (output) REAL array, dimension ( 2 )
          If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', RCONDE(1) and RCONDE(2) contain the
          reciprocal condition numbers for the average of the selected
          eigenvalues.
          Not referenced if SENSE = 'N' or 'V'.

  RCONDV  (output) REAL array, dimension ( 2 )
          If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', RCONDV(1) and RCONDV(2) contain the
          reciprocal condition number for the selected deflating
          subspaces.
          Not referenced if SENSE = 'N' or 'E'.

  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK.
          If N = 0, LWORK >= 1, else if SENSE = 'E', 'V', or 'B',
          LWORK >= MAX(1,2*N,2*SDIM*(N-SDIM)), else
          LWORK >= MAX(1,2*N).  Note that 2*SDIM*(N-SDIM) <= N*N/2.
          Note also that an error is only returned if
          LWORK < MAX(1,2*N), but if SENSE = 'E' or 'V' or 'B' this may
          not be large enough.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the bound on the optimal size of the WORK
          array and the minimum size of the IWORK array, returns these
          values as the first entries of the WORK and IWORK arrays, and
          no error message related to LWORK or LIWORK is issued by
          XERBLA.

  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension ( 8*N )
          Real workspace.

  IWORK   (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
          On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the minimum LIWORK.

  LIWORK  (input) INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK.
          If SENSE = 'N' or N = 0, LIWORK >= 1, otherwise
          LIWORK >= N+2.

          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the bound on the optimal size of the
          WORK array and the minimum size of the IWORK array, returns
          these values as the first entries of the WORK and IWORK
          arrays, and no error message related to LWORK or LIWORK is
          issued by XERBLA.

  BWORK   (workspace) LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
          Not referenced if SORT = 'N'.

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
          = 1,...,N:
                The QZ iteration failed.  (A,B) are not in Schur
                form, but ALPHA(j) and BETA(j) should be correct for
                j=INFO+1,...,N.
          > N:  =N+1: other than QZ iteration failed in CHGEQZ
                =N+2: after reordering, roundoff changed values of
                      some complex eigenvalues so that leading
                      eigenvalues in the Generalized Schur form no
                      longer satisfy SELCTG=.TRUE.  This could also
                      be caused due to scaling.
                =N+3: reordering failed in CTGSEN.
