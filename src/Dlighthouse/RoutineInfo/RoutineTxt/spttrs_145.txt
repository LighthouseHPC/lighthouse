  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> SPTTRS solves a tridiagonal system of the form A * X = B using the L*D*L**T factorization of A computed by SPTTRF.  D is a diagonal matrix specified in the vector D, L is a unit bidiagonal matrix whose subdiagonal is specified in the vector E, and X and B are N by NRHS matrices.
