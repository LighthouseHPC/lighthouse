  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> DPPTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric positive definite matrix A stored in packed format. The factorization has the form A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L', where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
