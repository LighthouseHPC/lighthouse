  DGELS solves overdetermined or underdetermined real linear systems
  involving an M-by-N matrix A, or its transpose, using a QR or LQ
  factorization of A.  It is assumed that A has full rank.

  The following options are provided:

  1. If TRANS = 'N' and m >= n:  find the least squares solution of
     an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                  minimize || B - A*X ||.

  2. If TRANS = 'N' and m < n:  find the minimum norm solution of
     an underdetermined system A * X = B.

  3. If TRANS = 'T' and m >= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
     an undetermined system A**T * X = B.

  4. If TRANS = 'T' and m < n:  find the least squares solution of
     an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                  minimize || B - A**T * X ||.

  Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
  handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
  M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
  matrix X.

  Arguments

  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'N': the linear system involves A;
          = 'T': the linear system involves A**T.

  M       (input) INTEGER
          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of
          columns of the matrices B and X. NRHS >=0.

  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
          On exit,
            if M >= N, A is overwritten by details of its QR
                       factorization as returned by DGEQRF;
            if M <  N, A is overwritten by details of its LQ
                       factorization as returned by DGELQF.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).

  B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          On entry, the matrix B of right hand side vectors, stored
          columnwise; B is M-by-NRHS if TRANS = 'N', or N-by-NRHS
          if TRANS = 'T'.
          On exit, if INFO = 0, B is overwritten by the solution
          vectors, stored columnwise:
          if TRANS = 'N' and m >= n, rows 1 to n of B contain the least
          squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares for the
          solution in each column is given by the sum of squares of
          elements N+1 to M in that column;
          if TRANS = 'N' and m < n, rows 1 to N of B contain the
          minimum norm solution vectors;
          if TRANS = 'T' and m >= n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
          minimum norm solution vectors;
          if TRANS = 'T' and m < n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
          least squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares
          for the solution in each column is given by the sum of
          squares of elements M+1 to N in that column.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= MAX(1,M,N).

  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK.
          LWORK >= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS ) ).
          For optimal performance,
          LWORK >= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS )*NB ).
          where MN = min(M,N) and NB is the optimum block size.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO =  i, the i-th diagonal element of the
                triangular factor of A is zero, so that A does not have
                full rank; the least squares solution could not be
                computed.
