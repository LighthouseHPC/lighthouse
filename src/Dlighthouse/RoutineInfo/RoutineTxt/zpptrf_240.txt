  ZPPTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a complex Hermitian
  positive definite matrix A stored in packed format.

  The factorization has the form
     A = U**H * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
     A = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  AP      (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
          is stored in the array AP as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
          See below for further details.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the
          Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, in the same
          storage format as A.

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
                positive definite, and the factorization could not be
                completed.
