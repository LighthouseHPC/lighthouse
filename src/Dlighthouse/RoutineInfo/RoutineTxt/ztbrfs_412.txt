  ZTBRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
  solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular band
  coefficient matrix.

  The solution matrix X must be computed by ZTBTRS or some other
  means before entering this routine.  ZTBRFS does not do iterative
  refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.

  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
          = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)

  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  KD      (input) INTEGER
          The number of superdiagonals or subdiagonals of the
          triangular band matrix A.  KD >= 0.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.

  AB      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB,N)
          The upper or lower triangular band matrix A, stored in the
          first kd+1 rows of the array. The j-th column of A is stored
          in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
          If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
          and are assumed to be 1.

  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.

  B       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          The right hand side matrix B.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  X       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
          The solution matrix X.

  LDX     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.

  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)

  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
