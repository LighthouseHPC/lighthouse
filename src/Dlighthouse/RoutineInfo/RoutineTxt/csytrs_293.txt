*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CSYTRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a complex
*  symmetric matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**T or
*  A = L*D*L**T computed by CSYTRF.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
*          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
*          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
*          obtain the factor U or L as computed by CSYTRF.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
*          as determined by CSYTRF.
*
*  B       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, the solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
