*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZHETRF computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian matrix A
*  using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method.  The form of the
*  factorization is
*
*     A = U*D*U**H  or  A = L*D*L**H
*
*  where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*  triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
*  1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
*
*  This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*          On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
*          to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
*          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
*          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
*          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
*          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
*          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of WORK.  LWORK >=1.  For best performance
*          LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned by ILAENV.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*                has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
*                exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
*                is used to solve a system of equations.
