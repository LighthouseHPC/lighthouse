  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> SPTSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations A*X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. A is factored as A = L*D*L**T, and the factored form of A is then used to solve the system of equations.
