  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> SGTSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B or A**T * X = B, where A is a tridiagonal matrix of order N and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also provided.<dl class="section user"><dt>Description: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> The following steps are performed: 1. If FACT = 'N', the LU decomposition is used to factor the matrix A as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation and unit lower bidiagonal matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in only the main diagonal and first two superdiagonals. 2. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below. 3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form of A. 4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates for it.
