  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> DPPEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a symmetric positive definite matrix A in packed storage and reduce its condition number (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale factors, S(i)=1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with elements B(i,j)=S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal. This choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal scalings.
