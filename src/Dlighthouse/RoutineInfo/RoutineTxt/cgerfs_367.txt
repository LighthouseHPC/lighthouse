  CGERFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
  equations and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for
  the solution.

  Arguments

  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
          = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.

  A       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The original N-by-N matrix A.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

  AF      (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAF,N)
          The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
          as computed by CGETRF.

  LDAF    (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).

  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          The pivot indices from CGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
          matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

  B       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          The right hand side matrix B.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  X       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
          On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by CGETRS.
          On exit, the improved solution matrix X.

  LDX     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

  FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.

  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)

  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

  Internal Parameters

  ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
