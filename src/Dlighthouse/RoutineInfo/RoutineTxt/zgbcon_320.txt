  ZGBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex
  general band matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm,
  using the LU factorization computed by ZGBTRF.

  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
  condition number is computed as
     RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).

  Arguments

  NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
          infinity-norm condition number is required:
          = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
          = 'I':         Infinity-norm.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  KL      (input) INTEGER
          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.

  KU      (input) INTEGER
          The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.

  AB      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB,N)
          Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
          computed by ZGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
          matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
          the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
          rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.

  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.

  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the matrix was
          interchanged with row IPIV(i).

  ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
          If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A.
          If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.

  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)

  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
