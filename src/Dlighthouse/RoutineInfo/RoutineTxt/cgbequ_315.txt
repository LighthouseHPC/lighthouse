  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> CGBEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an M-by-N band matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the row scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to make the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have absolute value 1. R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be between SMLNUM = smallest safe number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use of these scaling factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition number of A but works well in practice.
