CPBSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
   A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite band matrix and X
and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as
   A = U**H * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
   A = L * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
where U is an upper triangular band matrix, and L is a lower
triangular band matrix, with the same number of superdiagonals or
subdiagonals as A.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the
system of equations A * X = B.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
         matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] AB
         AB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band
         matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
         j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(KD+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KD)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(N,j+KD).
         See below for further details.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the
         Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the band
         matrix A, in the same storage format as A.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
\param[in,out] B
         B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i of A is not
               positive definite, so the factorization could not be
               completed, and the solution has not been computed.
