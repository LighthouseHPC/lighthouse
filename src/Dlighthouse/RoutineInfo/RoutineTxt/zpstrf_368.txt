  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> ZPSTRF computes the Cholesky factorization with complete pivoting of a complex Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix A. The factorization has the form P**T * A * P = U**H * U ,  if UPLO = 'U', P**T * A * P = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L', where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular, and P is stored as vector PIV. This algorithm does not attempt to check that A is positive semidefinite. This version of the algorithm calls level 3 BLAS.
