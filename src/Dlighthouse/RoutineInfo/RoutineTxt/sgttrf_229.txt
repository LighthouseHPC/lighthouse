*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SGTTRF computes an LU factorization of a real tridiagonal matrix A
*  using elimination with partial pivoting and row interchanges.
*
*  The factorization has the form
*     A = L * U
*  where L is a product of permutation and unit lower bidiagonal
*  matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in only the main
*  diagonal and first two superdiagonals.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.
*
*  DL      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, DL must contain the (n-1) sub-diagonal elements of
*          A.
*
*          On exit, DL is overwritten by the (n-1) multipliers that
*          define the matrix L from the LU factorization of A.
*
*  D       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, D must contain the diagonal elements of A.
*
*          On exit, D is overwritten by the n diagonal elements of the
*          upper triangular matrix U from the LU factorization of A.
*
*  DU      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, DU must contain the (n-1) super-diagonal elements
*          of A.
*
*          On exit, DU is overwritten by the (n-1) elements of the first
*          super-diagonal of U.
*
*  DU2     (output) REAL array, dimension (N-2)
*          On exit, DU2 is overwritten by the (n-2) elements of the
*          second super-diagonal of U.
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
*          interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
*          i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
*          required.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = k, U(k,k) is exactly zero. The factorization
*                has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*                singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*                to solve a system of equations.
