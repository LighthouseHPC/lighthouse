  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> DTRRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular coefficient matrix. The solution matrix X must be computed by DTRTRS or some other means before entering this routine.  DTRRFS does not do iterative refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.
