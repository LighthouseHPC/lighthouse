  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> SGESV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is used to factor A as A = P * L * U, where P is a permutation matrix, L is unit lower triangular, and U is upper triangular.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
