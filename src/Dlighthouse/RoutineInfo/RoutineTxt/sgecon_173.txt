  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> SGECON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a general real matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm, using the LU factorization computed by SGETRF. An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
