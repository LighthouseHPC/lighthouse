CGBRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
equations when the coefficient matrix is banded, and provides
error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form of the system of equations:
         = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
         = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
         = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KL
         KL is INTEGER
         The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
\param[in] KU
         KU is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         The original band matrix A, stored in rows 1 to KL+KU+1.
         The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
         array AB as follows:
         AB(ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(n,j+kl).
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KL+KU+1.
\param[in] AFB
         AFB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAFB,N)
         Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
         computed by CGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
         matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
         the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
         rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[in] LDAFB
         LDAFB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AFB.  LDAFB >= 2*KL*KU+1.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices from CGBTRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
         matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[in] B
         B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] X
         X is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by CGBTRS.
         On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
         overestimate of the true error.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
\par Internal Parameters:
 ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
