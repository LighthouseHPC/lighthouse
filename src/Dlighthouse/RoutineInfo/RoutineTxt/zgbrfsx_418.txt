   ZGBRFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
   equations and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
   for the solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code
   provides maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See
   comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the
   error bounds.
   The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
   before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED, R
   and C below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned
   are for the original unequilibrated system.
Arguments:
    Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
    settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
    defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
    can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
    the PARAMS argument.
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
    Specifies the form of the system of equations:
      = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
      = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
      = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
\param[in] EQUED
         EQUED is CHARACTER*1
    Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
    before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
    the solution and error bounds correctly.
      = 'N':  No equilibration
      = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
              diag(R).
      = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
              by diag(C).
      = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
              replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).
              The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
    The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KL
         KL is INTEGER
    The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
\param[in] KU
         KU is INTEGER
    The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
    The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
    of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB,N)
    The original band matrix A, stored in rows 1 to KL+KU+1.
    The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
    array AB as follows:
    AB(ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(n,j+kl).
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KL+KU+1.
\param[in] AFB
         AFB is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAFB,N)
    Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
    computed by DGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
    matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
    the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
    rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[in] LDAFB
         LDAFB is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array AFB.  LDAFB >= 2*KL*KU+1.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
    The pivot indices from DGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
    matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[in,out] R
         R is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
    The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
    multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
    is not accessed.  R is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
    otherwise, R is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
    EQUED = 'R' or 'B', each element of R must be positive.
    If R is output, each element of R is a power of the radix.
    If R is input, each element of R should be a power of the radix
    to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
    powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
    result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
    lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
    input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
    reliable.
\param[in,out] C
         C is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
    The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is
    multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C
    is not accessed.  C is an input argument if FACT = 'F';
    otherwise, C is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and
    EQUED = 'C' or 'B', each element of C must be positive.
    If C is output, each element of C is a power of the radix.
    If C is input, each element of C should be a power of the radix
    to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
    powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
    result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
    lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
    input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
    reliable.
\param[in] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
    The right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] X
         X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
    On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by DGETRS.
    On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
    Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
    reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
    equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
    precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
    to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
    if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
    conditioned.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (NRHS)
    Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
    componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
    (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
    makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[in] N_ERR_BNDS
         N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
    Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
    and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
    ERR_BNDS_COMP below.
\param[out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
         ERR_BNDS_NORM is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
    For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
    various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
    normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
    Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
            max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
           ------------------------------
                 max_j abs(X(j,i))
    The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
    below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
    returned.
    The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
    right-hand side.
    The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
    three fields:
    err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
             reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
             sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').
    err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
             almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
             so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
             sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
             be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
    err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
             reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
             sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
             estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
             numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
             appropriately scaled matrix Z.
             Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
             radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.
    See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
    cautions.
\param[out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
         ERR_BNDS_COMP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
    For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
    various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
    componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
    Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                   abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
            max_j ----------------------
                        abs(X(j,i))
    The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
    componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
    information as described below. There currently are up to three
    pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
    componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
    ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
    the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.
    The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
    right-hand side.
    The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
    three fields:
    err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
             reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
             sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').
    err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
             almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
             so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
             sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
             be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
    err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
             reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
             sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
             estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
             numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
             appropriately scaled matrix Z.
             Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
             current right-hand side and S scales each row of
             A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
             sums of Z are approximately 1.
    See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
    cautions.
\param[in] NPARAMS
         NPARAMS is INTEGER
    Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If .LE. 0, the
    PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.
\param[in,out] PARAMS
         PARAMS is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension NPARAMS
    Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is .LT. 0.0, then
    that entry will be filled with default value used for that
    parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
    are used for higher-numbered parameters.
      PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
           refinement or not.
        Default: 1.0D+0
           = 0.0 : No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
                   computed.
           = 1.0 : Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
                   possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                   compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                   PRECISION.
             (other values are reserved for future use)
      PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
           computations allowed for refinement.
        Default: 10
        Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                    factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                    the factorization uses a technique other than
                    Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                    err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                    trustworthy.
      PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
           will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
           relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
           is true, 0.0 is false.
        Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
      = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
        guaranteed.
      < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
      > 0 and <= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
        has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
        the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
        is returned.
      = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
        not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
        hand sides K with K > J may not be guaranteed as well, but
        only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
        componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
        the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
        bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
        that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)
        the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
        componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
        J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
        ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
        ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,1) and ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,1). To get information
        about all of the right-hand sides check ERR_BNDS_NORM or
        ERR_BNDS_COMP.
