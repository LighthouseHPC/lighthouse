CPPEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
Hermitian positive definite matrix A in packed storage and reduce
its condition number (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the
scale factors, S(i)=1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix
B with elements B(i,j)=S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.
This choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of
the smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
scalings.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] AP
         AP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         The upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix A, packed
         columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored
         in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
\param[out] S
         S is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.
\param[out] SCOND
         SCOND is REAL
         If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
         the largest S(i).  If SCOND >= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
         large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.
\param[out] AMAX
         AMAX is REAL
         Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
         close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
         should be scaled.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element is nonpositive.
