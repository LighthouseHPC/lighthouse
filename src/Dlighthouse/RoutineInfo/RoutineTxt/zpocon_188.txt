  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> ZPOCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the 1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix using the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by ZPOTRF. An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
