  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> ZGTCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex tridiagonal matrix A using the LU factorization as computed by ZGTTRF. An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
