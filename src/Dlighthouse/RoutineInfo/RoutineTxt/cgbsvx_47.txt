  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> CGBSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B, where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals and KU superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also provided.<dl class="section user"><dt>Description: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> The following steps are performed by this subroutine: 1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate the system: TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)  *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N') or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C'). 2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is upper triangular with KL+KU superdiagonals. 3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below. 4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form of A. 5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates for it. 6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so that it solves the original system before equilibration.
