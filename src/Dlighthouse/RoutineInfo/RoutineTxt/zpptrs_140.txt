  ZPPTRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a Hermitian
  positive definite matrix A in packed storage using the Cholesky
  factorization A = U**H * U or A = L * L**H computed by ZPPTRF.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

  AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
          A = U**H * U or A = L * L**H, packed columnwise in a linear
          array.  The j-th column of U or L is stored in the array AP
          as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = U(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = L(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

  B       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
          On exit, the solution matrix X.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
