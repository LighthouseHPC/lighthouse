DTBTRS solves a triangular system of the form
   A * X = B  or  A**T * X = B,
where A is a triangular band matrix of order N, and B is an
N-by NRHS matrix.  A check is made to verify that A is nonsingular.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
         = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form the system of equations:
         = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
         = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
         = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
\param[in] DIAG
         DIAG is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
         = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals or subdiagonals of the
         triangular band matrix A.  KD >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         The upper or lower triangular band matrix A, stored in the
         first kd+1 rows of AB.  The j-th column of A is stored
         in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
         If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
         and are assumed to be 1.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element of A is zero,
               indicating that the matrix is singular and the
               solutions X have not been computed.
