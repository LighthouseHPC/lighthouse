  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> STRCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a triangular matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm. The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
