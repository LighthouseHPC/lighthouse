DPBRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
equations when the coefficient matrix is symmetric positive definite
and banded, and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
for the solution.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         The upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band matrix A,
         stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The j-th column
         of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
\param[in] AFB
         AFB is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAFB,N)
         The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
         A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the band matrix A as computed by
         DPBTRF, in the same storage format as A (see AB).
\param[in] LDAFB
         LDAFB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AFB.  LDAFB >= KD+1.
\param[in] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] X
         X is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by DPBTRS.
         On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
         overestimate of the true error.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
\par Internal Parameters:
 ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
