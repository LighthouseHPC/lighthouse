  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> SGTTRF computes an LU factorization of a real tridiagonal matrix A using elimination with partial pivoting and row interchanges. The factorization has the form A = L * U where L is a product of permutation and unit lower bidiagonal matrices and U is upper triangular with nonzeros in only the main diagonal and first two superdiagonals.
