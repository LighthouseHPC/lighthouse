ZTRRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular
coefficient matrix.
The solution matrix X must be computed by ZTRTRS or some other
means before entering this routine.  ZTRRFS does not do iterative
refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
         = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form of the system of equations:
         = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
         = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
         = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)
\param[in] DIAG
         DIAG is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
         = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
         upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper
         triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of
         A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
         triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular
         matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
         referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are
         also not referenced and are assumed to be 1.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] B
         B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in] X
         X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         The solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
         overestimate of the true error.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
