   ZLA_GBRCOND_X Computes the infinity norm condition number of
   op(A) * diag(X) where X is a COMPLEX*16 vector.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
    Specifies the form of the system of equations:
      = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
      = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
      = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate Transpose = Transpose)
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
    The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
    matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KL
         KL is INTEGER
    The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
\param[in] KU
         KU is INTEGER
    The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB,N)
    On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows 1 to KL+KU+1.
    The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
    array AB as follows:
    AB(KU+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KU)<=i<=min(N,j+kl)
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KL+KU+1.
\param[in] AFB
         AFB is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAFB,N)
    Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
    computed by ZGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular
    band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1,
    and the multipliers used during the factorization are stored
    in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[in] LDAFB
         LDAFB is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array AFB.  LDAFB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
    The pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
    as computed by ZGBTRF; row i of the matrix was interchanged
    with row IPIV(i).
\param[in] X
         X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
    The vector X in the formula op(A) * diag(X).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
      = 0:  Successful exit.
    i > 0:  The ith argument is invalid.
\param[in] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N).
    Workspace.
\param[in] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N).
    Workspace.
