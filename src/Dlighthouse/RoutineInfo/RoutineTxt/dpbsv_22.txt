  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> DPBSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite band matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L', where U is an upper triangular band matrix, and L is a lower triangular band matrix, with the same number of superdiagonals or subdiagonals as A.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
