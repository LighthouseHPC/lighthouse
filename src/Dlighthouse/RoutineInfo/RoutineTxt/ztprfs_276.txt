  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> ZTPRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular packed coefficient matrix. The solution matrix X must be computed by ZTPTRS or some other means before entering this routine.  ZTPRFS does not do iterative refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.
