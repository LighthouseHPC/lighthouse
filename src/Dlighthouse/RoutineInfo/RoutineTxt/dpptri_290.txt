DPPTRI computes the inverse of a real symmetric positive definite
matrix A using the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T
computed by DPPTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangular factor is stored in AP;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular factor is stored in AP.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, packed columnwise as
         a linear array.  The j-th column of U or L is stored in the
         array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = U(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = L(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the upper or lower triangle of the (symmetric)
         inverse of A, overwriting the input factor U or L.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the (i,i) element of the factor U or L is
               zero, and the inverse could not be computed.
