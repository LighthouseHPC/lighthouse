  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> DPTSVX uses the factorization A = L*D*L**T to compute the solution to a real system of linear equations A*X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also provided.<dl class="section user"><dt>Description: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> The following steps are performed: 1. If FACT = 'N', the matrix A is factored as A = L*D*L**T, where L is a unit lower bidiagonal matrix and D is diagonal.  The factorization can also be regarded as having the form A = U**T*D*U. 2. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite, then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below. 3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form of A. 4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates for it.
