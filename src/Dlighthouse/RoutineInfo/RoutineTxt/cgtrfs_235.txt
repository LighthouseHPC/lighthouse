  CGTRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
  equations when the coefficient matrix is tridiagonal, and provides
  error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.

  Arguments

  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
          = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

  DL      (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (N-1)
          The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of A.

  D       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
          The diagonal elements of A.

  DU      (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (N-1)
          The (n-1) superdiagonal elements of A.

  DLF     (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (N-1)
          The (n-1) multipliers that define the matrix L from the
          LU factorization of A as computed by CGTTRF.

  DF      (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
          The n diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix U from
          the LU factorization of A.

  DUF     (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (N-1)
          The (n-1) elements of the first superdiagonal of U.

  DU2     (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (N-2)
          The (n-2) elements of the second superdiagonal of U.

  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
          interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
          i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
          required.

  B       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          The right hand side matrix B.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  X       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
          On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by CGTTRS.
          On exit, the improved solution matrix X.

  LDX     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

  FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.

  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)

  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

  Internal Parameters

  ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
