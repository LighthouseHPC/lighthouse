  DPTTRF computes the L*D*L**T factorization of a real symmetric
  positive definite tridiagonal matrix A.  The factorization may also
  be regarded as having the form A = U**T*D*U.

  Arguments

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  D       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
          On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
          A.  On exit, the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix
          D from the L*D*L**T factorization of A.

  E       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
          On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
          matrix A.  On exit, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the
          unit bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**T factorization of A.
          E can also be regarded as the superdiagonal of the unit
          bidiagonal factor U from the U**T*D*U factorization of A.

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit
          < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0: if INFO = k, the leading minor of order k is not
               positive definite; if k < N, the factorization could not
               be completed, while if k = N, the factorization was
               completed, but D(N) <= 0.
