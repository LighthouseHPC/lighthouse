  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> ZPTTRS solves a tridiagonal system of the form A * X = B using the factorization A = U**H *D* U or A = L*D*L**H computed by ZPTTRF. D is a diagonal matrix specified in the vector D, U (or L) is a unit bidiagonal matrix whose superdiagonal (subdiagonal) is specified in the vector E, and X and B are N by NRHS matrices.
