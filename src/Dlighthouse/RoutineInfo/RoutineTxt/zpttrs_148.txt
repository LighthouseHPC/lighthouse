ZPTTRS solves a tridiagonal system of the form
   A * X = B
using the factorization A = U**H *D* U or A = L*D*L**H computed by ZPTTRF.
D is a diagonal matrix specified in the vector D, U (or L) is a unit
bidiagonal matrix whose superdiagonal (subdiagonal) is specified in
the vector E, and X and B are N by NRHS matrices.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form of the factorization and whether the
         vector E is the superdiagonal of the upper bidiagonal factor
         U or the subdiagonal of the lower bidiagonal factor L.
         = 'U':  A = U**H *D*U, E is the superdiagonal of U
         = 'L':  A = L*D*L**H, E is the subdiagonal of L
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the tridiagonal matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D from the
         factorization A = U**H *D*U or A = L*D*L**H.
\param[in] E
         E is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         If UPLO = 'U', the (n-1) superdiagonal elements of the unit
         bidiagonal factor U from the factorization A = U**H*D*U.
         If UPLO = 'L', the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit
         bidiagonal factor L from the factorization A = L*D*L**H.
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side vectors B for the system of
         linear equations.
         On exit, the solution vectors, X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
