SSPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a real symmetric packed matrix A using the factorization
A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by SSPTRF.
An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
         as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
         = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] AP
         AP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
         obtain the factor U or L as computed by SSPTRF, stored as a
         packed triangular matrix.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
         as determined by SSPTRF.
\param[in] ANORM
         ANORM is REAL
         The 1-norm of the original matrix A.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is REAL
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
         estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
