*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SPBRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
*  equations when the coefficient matrix is symmetric positive definite
*  and banded, and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
*  for the solution.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KD      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
*          or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input) REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          The upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band matrix A,
*          stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The j-th column
*          of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
*
*  AFB     (input) REAL array, dimension (LDAFB,N)
*          The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
*          A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the band matrix A as computed by
*          SPBTRF, in the same storage format as A (see AB).
*
*  LDAFB   (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AFB.  LDAFB >= KD+1.
*
*  B       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          The right hand side matrix B.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  X       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
*          On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by SPBTRS.
*          On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
*
*  LDX     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*
*  FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
*          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
*          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
*          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
*          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
*          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
*          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
*          overestimate of the true error.
*
*  BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
*          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
*          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
*  Internal Parameters
*  ===================
*
*  ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
