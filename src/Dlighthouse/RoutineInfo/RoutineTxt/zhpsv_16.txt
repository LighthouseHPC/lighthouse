  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> ZHPSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix stored in packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. The diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as A = U * D * U**H,  if UPLO = 'U', or A = L * D * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L', where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower) triangular matrices, D is Hermitian and block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
