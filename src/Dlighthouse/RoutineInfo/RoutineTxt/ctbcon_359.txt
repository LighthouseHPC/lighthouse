  CTBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a
  triangular band matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.

  The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
  norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
  computed as
     RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).

  Arguments

  NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
          infinity-norm condition number is required:
          = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
          = 'I':         Infinity-norm.

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.

  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  KD      (input) INTEGER
          The number of superdiagonals or subdiagonals of the
          triangular band matrix A.  KD >= 0.

  AB      (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
          The upper or lower triangular band matrix A, stored in the
          first kd+1 rows of the array. The j-th column of A is stored
          in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
          If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
          and are assumed to be 1.

  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.

  RCOND   (output) REAL
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)

  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
