  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> CPOSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as A = U**H* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or A = L * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L', where U is an upper triangular matrix and  L is a lower triangular matrix.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
