  ZPOCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
  1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix using the
  Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by ZPOTRF.

  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  A       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
          A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, as computed by ZPOTRF.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

  ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
          The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the Hermitian matrix A.

  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)

  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
