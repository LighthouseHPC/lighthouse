  ZGTTRS solves one of the systems of equations
     A * X = B,  A**T * X = B,  or  A**H * X = B,
  with a tridiagonal matrix A using the LU factorization computed
  by ZGTTRF.

  Arguments

  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the form of the system of equations.
          = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

  DL      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
          The (n-1) multipliers that define the matrix L from the
          LU factorization of A.

  D       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
          The n diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix U from
          the LU factorization of A.

  DU      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
          The (n-1) elements of the first super-diagonal of U.

  DU2     (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-2)
          The (n-2) elements of the second super-diagonal of U.

  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
          interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
          i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
          required.

  B       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          On entry, the matrix of right hand side vectors B.
          On exit, B is overwritten by the solution vectors X.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
