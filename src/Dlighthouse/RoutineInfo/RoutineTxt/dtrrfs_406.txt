  DTRRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
  solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular
  coefficient matrix.

  The solution matrix X must be computed by DTRTRS or some other
  means before entering this routine.  DTRRFS does not do iterative
  refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.

  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
          = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.

  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
          upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper
          triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of
          A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
          triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular
          matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
          referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are
          also not referenced and are assumed to be 1.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

  B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          The right hand side matrix B.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  X       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
          The solution matrix X.

  LDX     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.

  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)

  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
