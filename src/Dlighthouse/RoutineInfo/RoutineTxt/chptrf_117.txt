  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> CHPTRF computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian packed matrix A using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method: A = U*D*U**H  or  A = L*D*L**H where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower) triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
