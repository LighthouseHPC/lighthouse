  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> DGERFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear equations and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds. The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED, R and C below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned are for the original unequilibrated system.</pre> <pre class="fragment">  Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These  settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the  defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users  can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing  the PARAMS argument.</pre></dd></dl>
