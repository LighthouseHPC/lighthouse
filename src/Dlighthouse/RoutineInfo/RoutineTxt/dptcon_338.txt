*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DPTCON computes the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
*  1-norm) of a real symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix
*  using the factorization A = L*D*L**T or A = U**T*D*U computed by
*  DPTTRF.
*
*  Norm(inv(A)) is computed by a direct method, and the reciprocal of
*  the condition number is computed as
*               RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D from the
*          factorization of A, as computed by DPTTRF.
*
*  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the unit bidiagonal factor
*          U or L from the factorization of A,  as computed by DPTTRF.
*
*  ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The 1-norm of the original matrix A.
*
*  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is the
*          1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
