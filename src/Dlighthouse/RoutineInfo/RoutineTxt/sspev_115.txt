  SSPEV computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
  real symmetric matrix A in packed storage.

  Arguments

  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  AP      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
          is stored in the array AP as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

          On exit, AP is overwritten by values generated during the
          reduction to tridiagonal form.  If UPLO = 'U', the diagonal
          and first superdiagonal of the tridiagonal matrix T overwrite
          the corresponding elements of A, and if UPLO = 'L', the
          diagonal and first subdiagonal of T overwrite the
          corresponding elements of A.

  W       (output) REAL array, dimension (N)
          If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.

  Z       (output) REAL array, dimension (LDZ, N)
          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the orthonormal
          eigenvectors of the matrix A, with the i-th column of Z
          holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.

  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).

  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (3*N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit.
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
          > 0:  if INFO = i, the algorithm failed to converge; i
                off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal
                form did not converge to zero.
