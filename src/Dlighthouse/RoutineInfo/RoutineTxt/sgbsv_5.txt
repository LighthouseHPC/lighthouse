  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> SGBSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B, where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals and KU superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is used to factor A as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is upper triangular with KL+KU superdiagonals.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
