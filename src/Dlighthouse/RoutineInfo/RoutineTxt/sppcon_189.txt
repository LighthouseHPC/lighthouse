SPPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a real symmetric positive definite packed matrix using
the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T computed by
SPPTRF.
An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] AP
         AP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
         A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, packed columnwise in a linear
         array.  The j-th column of U or L is stored in the array AP
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = U(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = L(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
\param[in] ANORM
         ANORM is REAL
         The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the symmetric matrix A.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is REAL
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
         estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (3*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
