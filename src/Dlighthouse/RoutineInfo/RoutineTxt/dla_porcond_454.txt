  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> DLA_PORCOND Estimates the Skeel condition number of  op(A) * op2(C) where op2 is determined by CMODE as follows CMODE =  1 op2(C) = C CMODE =  0 op2(C) = I CMODE = -1 op2(C) = inv(C) The Skeel condition number  cond(A) = norminf( |inv(A)||A| ) is computed by computing scaling factors R such that diag(R)*A*op2(C) is row equilibrated and computing the standard infinity-norm condition number.
