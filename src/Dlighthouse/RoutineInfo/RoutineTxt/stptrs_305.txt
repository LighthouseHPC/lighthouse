*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  STPTRS solves a triangular system of the form
*
*     A * X = B  or  A**T * X = B,
*
*  where A is a triangular matrix of order N stored in packed format,
*  and B is an N-by-NRHS matrix.  A check is made to verify that A is
*  nonsingular.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
*          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
*
*  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
*          = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
*          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
*          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
*
*  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
*          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input) REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          The upper or lower triangular matrix A, packed columnwise in
*          a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored in the array
*          AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*
*  B       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element of A is zero,
*                indicating that the matrix is singular and the
*                solutions X have not been computed.
