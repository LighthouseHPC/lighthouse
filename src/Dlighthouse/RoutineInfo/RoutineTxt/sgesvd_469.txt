*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SGESVD computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
*  M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and/or right singular
*  vectors. The SVD is written
*
*       A = U * SIGMA * transpose(V)
*
*  where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its
*  min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, and
*  V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA
*  are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and
*  are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of
*  U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.
*
*  Note that the routine returns V**T, not V.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBU    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies options for computing all or part of the matrix U:
*          = 'A':  all M columns of U are returned in array U:
*          = 'S':  the first min(m,n) columns of U (the left singular
*                  vectors) are returned in the array U;
*          = 'O':  the first min(m,n) columns of U (the left singular
*                  vectors) are overwritten on the array A;
*          = 'N':  no columns of U (no left singular vectors) are
*                  computed.
*
*  JOBVT   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies options for computing all or part of the matrix
*          V**T:
*          = 'A':  all N rows of V**T are returned in the array VT;
*          = 'S':  the first min(m,n) rows of V**T (the right singular
*                  vectors) are returned in the array VT;
*          = 'O':  the first min(m,n) rows of V**T (the right singular
*                  vectors) are overwritten on the array A;
*          = 'N':  no rows of V**T (no right singular vectors) are
*                  computed.
*
*          JOBVT and JOBU cannot both be 'O'.
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the input matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the input matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
*          On exit,
*          if JOBU = 'O',  A is overwritten with the first min(m,n)
*                          columns of U (the left singular vectors,
*                          stored columnwise);
*          if JOBVT = 'O', A is overwritten with the first min(m,n)
*                          rows of V**T (the right singular vectors,
*                          stored rowwise);
*          if JOBU .ne. 'O' and JOBVT .ne. 'O', the contents of A
*                          are destroyed.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  S       (output) REAL array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The singular values of A, sorted so that S(i) >= S(i+1).
*
*  U       (output) REAL array, dimension (LDU,UCOL)
*          (LDU,M) if JOBU = 'A' or (LDU,min(M,N)) if JOBU = 'S'.
*          If JOBU = 'A', U contains the M-by-M orthogonal matrix U;
*          if JOBU = 'S', U contains the first min(m,n) columns of U
*          (the left singular vectors, stored columnwise);
*          if JOBU = 'N' or 'O', U is not referenced.
*
*  LDU     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array U.  LDU >= 1; if
*          JOBU = 'S' or 'A', LDU >= M.
*
*  VT      (output) REAL array, dimension (LDVT,N)
*          If JOBVT = 'A', VT contains the N-by-N orthogonal matrix
*          V**T;
*          if JOBVT = 'S', VT contains the first min(m,n) rows of
*          V**T (the right singular vectors, stored rowwise);
*          if JOBVT = 'N' or 'O', VT is not referenced.
*
*  LDVT    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VT.  LDVT >= 1; if
*          JOBVT = 'A', LDVT >= N; if JOBVT = 'S', LDVT >= min(M,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK;
*          if INFO > 0, WORK(2:MIN(M,N)) contains the unconverged
*          superdiagonal elements of an upper bidiagonal matrix B
*          whose diagonal is in S (not necessarily sorted). B
*          satisfies A = U * B * VT, so it has the same singular values
*          as A, and singular vectors related by U and VT.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.
*          LWORK >= MAX(1,5*MIN(M,N)) for the paths (see comments inside code):
*             - PATH 1  (M much larger than N, JOBU='N') 
*             - PATH 1t (N much larger than M, JOBVT='N')
*          LWORK >= MAX(1,3*MIN(M,N)+MAX(M,N),5*MIN(M,N)) for the other paths
*          For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit.
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*          > 0:  if SBDSQR did not converge, INFO specifies how many
*                superdiagonals of an intermediate bidiagonal form B
*                did not converge to zero. See the description of WORK
*                above for details.
