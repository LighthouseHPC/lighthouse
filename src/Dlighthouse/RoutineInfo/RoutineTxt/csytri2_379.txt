  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> CSYTRI2 computes the inverse of a COMPLEX hermitian indefinite matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by CSYTRF. CSYTRI2 sets the LEADING DIMENSION of the workspace before calling CSYTRI2X that actually computes the inverse.
