  CPBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
  1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite band matrix using
  the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by
  CPBTRF.

  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangular factor stored in AB;
          = 'L':  Lower triangular factor stored in AB.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  KD      (input) INTEGER
          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
          or the number of sub-diagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.

  AB      (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
          The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
          A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the band matrix A, stored in the
          first KD+1 rows of the array.  The j-th column of U or L is
          stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
          if UPLO ='U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = U(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
          if UPLO ='L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = L(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).

  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.

  ANORM   (input) REAL
          The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the Hermitian band matrix A.

  RCOND   (output) REAL
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)

  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
