  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> SSPTRF computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A stored in packed format using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method: A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower) triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
