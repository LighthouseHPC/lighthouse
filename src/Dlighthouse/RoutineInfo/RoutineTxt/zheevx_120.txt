*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZHEEVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
*  of a complex Hermitian matrix A.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can
*  be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
*  indices for the desired eigenvalues.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
*
*  RANGE   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found.
*          = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
*                 will be found.
*          = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA, N)
*          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
*          leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
*          upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
*          the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
*          the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
*          On exit, the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') or the upper
*          triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the diagonal, is
*          destroyed.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  VL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*  VU      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
*          be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
*
*  IL      (input) INTEGER
*  IU      (input) INTEGER
*          If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
*          smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
*          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
*
*  ABSTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
*          An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
*          when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
*          of width less than or equal to
*
*                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
*
*          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
*          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
*          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
*          by reducing A to tridiagonal form.
*
*          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
*          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*DLAMCH('S'), not zero.
*          If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
*          eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
*          2*DLAMCH('S').
*
*          See "Computing Small Singular Values of Bidiagonal Matrices
*          with Guaranteed High Relative Accuracy," by Demmel and
*          Kahan, LAPACK Working Note #3.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
*          If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
*
*  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On normal exit, the first M elements contain the selected
*          eigenvalues in ascending order.
*
*  Z       (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
*          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
*          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
*          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
*          If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
*          contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
*          index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
*          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
*          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= 1, when N <= 1;
*          otherwise 2*N.
*          For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+1)*N,
*          where NB is the max of the blocksize for ZHETRD and for
*          ZUNMTR as returned by ILAENV.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (7*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (5*N)
*
*  IFAIL   (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
*          IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
*          indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, then i eigenvectors failed to converge.
*                Their indices are stored in array IFAIL.
