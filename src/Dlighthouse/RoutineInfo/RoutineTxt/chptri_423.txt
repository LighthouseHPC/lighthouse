  CHPTRI computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix
  A in packed storage using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
  A = L*D*L**H computed by CHPTRF.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;
          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  AP      (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          On entry, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
          used to obtain the factor U or L as computed by CHPTRF,
          stored as a packed triangular matrix.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the (Hermitian) inverse of the original
          matrix, stored as a packed triangular matrix. The j-th column
          of inv(A) is stored in the array AP as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = inv(A)(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L',
             AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = inv(A)(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
          as determined by CHPTRF.

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit
          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) = 0; the matrix is singular and its
               inverse could not be computed.
