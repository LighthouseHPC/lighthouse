  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> CSYSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also provided.<dl class="section user"><dt>Description: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> The following steps are performed: 1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A. The form of the factorization is A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L', where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower) triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks. 2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below. 3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form of A. 4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates for it.
