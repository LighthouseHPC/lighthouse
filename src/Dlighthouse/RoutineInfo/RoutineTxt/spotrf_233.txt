  SPOTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
  positive definite matrix A.

  The factorization has the form
     A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
     A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

  This is the block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
          triangular part of A is not referenced.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
                positive definite, and the factorization could not be
                completed.
