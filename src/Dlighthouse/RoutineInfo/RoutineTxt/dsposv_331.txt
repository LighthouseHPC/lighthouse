  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> DSPOSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. DSPOSV first attempts to factorize the matrix in SINGLE PRECISION and use this factorization within an iterative refinement procedure to produce a solution with DOUBLE PRECISION normwise backward error quality (see below). If the approach fails the method switches to a DOUBLE PRECISION factorization and solve. The iterative refinement is not going to be a winning strategy if the ratio SINGLE PRECISION performance over DOUBLE PRECISION performance is too small. A reasonable strategy should take the number of right-hand sides and the size of the matrix into account. This might be done with a call to ILAENV in the future. Up to now, we always try iterative refinement. The iterative refinement process is stopped if  ITER &gt; ITERMAX or for all the RHS we have:  RNRM &lt; SQRT(N)*XNRM*ANRM*EPS*BWDMAX where  o ITER is the number of the current iteration in the iterative refinement process  o RNRM is the infinity-norm of the residual  o XNRM is the infinity-norm of the solution  o ANRM is the infinity-operator-norm of the matrix A  o EPS is the machine epsilon returned by DLAMCH('Epsilon') The value ITERMAX and BWDMAX are fixed to 30 and 1.0D+00 respectively.
