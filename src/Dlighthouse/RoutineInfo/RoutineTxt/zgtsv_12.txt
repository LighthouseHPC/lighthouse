  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> ZGTSV  solves the equation A*X = B, where A is an N-by-N tridiagonal matrix, by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. Note that the equation  A**T *X = B  may be solved by interchanging the order of the arguments DU and DL.
