  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> ZGETRF computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A using partial pivoting with row interchanges. The factorization has the form A = P * L * U where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m &gt; n), and U is upper triangular (upper trapezoidal if m &lt; n). This is the right-looking Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.
