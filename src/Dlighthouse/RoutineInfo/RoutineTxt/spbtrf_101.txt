  SPBTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
  positive definite band matrix A.

  The factorization has the form
     A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
     A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  KD      (input) INTEGER
          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
          or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.

  AB      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
          matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
          j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
          as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the
          Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the band
          matrix A, in the same storage format as A.

  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
                positive definite, and the factorization could not be
                completed.
