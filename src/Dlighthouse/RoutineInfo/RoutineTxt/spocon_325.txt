*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SPOCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the 
*  1-norm) of a real symmetric positive definite matrix using the
*  Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T computed by SPOTRF.
*
*  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
*  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
*          A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by SPOTRF.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  ANORM   (input) REAL
*          The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the symmetric matrix A.
*
*  RCOND   (output) REAL
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
*          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
