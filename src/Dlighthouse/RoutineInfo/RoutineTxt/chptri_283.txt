CHPTRI computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian indefinite matrix
A in packed storage using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
A = L*D*L**H computed by CHPTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
         as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
         = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
         used to obtain the factor U or L as computed by CHPTRF,
         stored as a packed triangular matrix.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the (Hermitian) inverse of the original
         matrix, stored as a packed triangular matrix. The j-th column
         of inv(A) is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = inv(A)(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L',
            AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = inv(A)(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
         as determined by CHPTRF.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) = 0; the matrix is singular and its
              inverse could not be computed.
