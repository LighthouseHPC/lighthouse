ZPOTRI computes the inverse of a complex Hermitian positive definite
matrix A using the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H
computed by ZPOTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, as computed by
         ZPOTRF.
         On exit, the upper or lower triangle of the (Hermitian)
         inverse of A, overwriting the input factor U or L.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the (i,i) element of the factor U or L is
               zero, and the inverse could not be computed.
