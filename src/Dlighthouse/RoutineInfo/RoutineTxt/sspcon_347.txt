  SSPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
  1-norm) of a real symmetric packed matrix A using the factorization
  A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by SSPTRF.

  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  AP      (input) REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
          obtain the factor U or L as computed by SSPTRF, stored as a
          packed triangular matrix.

  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
          as determined by SSPTRF.

  ANORM   (input) REAL
          The 1-norm of the original matrix A.

  RCOND   (output) REAL
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (2*N)

  IWORK    (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
