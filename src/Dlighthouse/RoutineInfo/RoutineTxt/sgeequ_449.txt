  SGEEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an
  M-by-N matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the row
  scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to make
  the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with
  elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have absolute value 1.

  R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be between SMLNUM = smallest safe
  number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use of these scaling
  factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition number of A but
  works well in practice.

  Arguments

  M       (input) INTEGER
          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  A       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The M-by-N matrix whose equilibration factors are
          to be computed.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).

  R       (output) REAL array, dimension (M)
          If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, R contains the row scale factors
          for A.

  C       (output) REAL array, dimension (N)
          If INFO = 0,  C contains the column scale factors for A.

  ROWCND  (output) REAL
          If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, ROWCND contains the ratio of the
          smallest R(i) to the largest R(i).  If ROWCND >= 0.1 and
          AMAX is neither too large nor too small, it is not worth
          scaling by R.

  COLCND  (output) REAL
          If INFO = 0, COLCND contains the ratio of the smallest
          C(i) to the largest C(i).  If COLCND >= 0.1, it is not
          worth scaling by C.

  AMAX    (output) REAL
          Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
          close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
          should be scaled.

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i,  and i is
                <= M:  the i-th row of A is exactly zero
                >  M:  the (i-M)-th column of A is exactly zero
