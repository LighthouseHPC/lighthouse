  ZHERFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
  equations when the coefficient matrix is Hermitian indefinite, and
  provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.

  A       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
          upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
          of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
          is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
          triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
          the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is
          not referenced.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

  AF      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
          The factored form of the matrix A.  AF contains the block
          diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to obtain the
          factor U or L from the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
          A = L*D*L**H as computed by ZHETRF.

  LDAF    (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).

  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
          as determined by ZHETRF.

  B       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          The right hand side matrix B.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  X       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
          On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by ZHETRS.
          On exit, the improved solution matrix X.

  LDX     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.

  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)

  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

  Internal Parameters

  ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
