  ZPBRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
  equations when the coefficient matrix is Hermitian positive definite
  and banded, and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
  for the solution.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  KD      (input) INTEGER
          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
          or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.

  AB      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
          The upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band matrix A,
          stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The j-th column
          of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).

  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.

  AFB     (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAFB,N)
          The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
          A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the band matrix A as computed by
          ZPBTRF, in the same storage format as A (see AB).

  LDAFB   (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array AFB.  LDAFB >= KD+1.

  B       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          The right hand side matrix B.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  X       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
          On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by ZPBTRS.
          On exit, the improved solution matrix X.

  LDX     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

  FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.

  BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)

  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

  Internal Parameters

  ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
