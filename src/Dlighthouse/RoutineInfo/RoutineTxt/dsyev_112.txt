  DSYEV computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
  real symmetric matrix A.

  Arguments

  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
          leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
          upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
          the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
          the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
          On exit, if JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, A contains the
          orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A.
          If JOBZ = 'N', then on exit the lower triangle (if UPLO='L')
          or the upper triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the
          diagonal, is destroyed.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
          If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.

  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
          The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,3*N-1).
          For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+2)*N,
          where NB is the blocksize for DSYTRD returned by ILAENV.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, the algorithm failed to converge; i
                off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal
                form did not converge to zero.
