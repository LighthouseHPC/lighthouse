*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SGBTRS solves a system of linear equations
*     A * X = B  or  A**T * X = B
*  with a general band matrix A using the LU factorization computed
*  by SGBTRF.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the form of the system of equations.
*          = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
*          = 'T':  A**T* X = B  (Transpose)
*          = 'C':  A**T* X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KL      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
*
*  KU      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input) REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
*          computed by SGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
*          matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
*          the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
*          rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
*
*  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the matrix was
*          interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  B       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, the solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
