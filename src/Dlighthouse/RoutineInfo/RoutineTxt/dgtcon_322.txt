  DGTCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a real
  tridiagonal matrix A using the LU factorization as computed by
  DGTTRF.

  An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
  condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

  Arguments

  NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
          infinity-norm condition number is required:
          = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
          = 'I':         Infinity-norm.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  DL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
          The (n-1) multipliers that define the matrix L from the
          LU factorization of A as computed by DGTTRF.

  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
          The n diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix U from
          the LU factorization of A.

  DU      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
          The (n-1) elements of the first superdiagonal of U.

  DU2     (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-2)
          The (n-2) elements of the second superdiagonal of U.

  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= n, row i of the matrix was
          interchanged with row IPIV(i).  IPIV(i) will always be either
          i or i+1; IPIV(i) = i indicates a row interchange was not
          required.

  ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
          If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A.
          If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.

  RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2*N)

  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
