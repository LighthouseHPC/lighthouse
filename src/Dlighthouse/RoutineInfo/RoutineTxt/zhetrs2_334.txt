  ZHETRS2 solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a complex
  Hermitian matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
  A = L*D*L**H computed by ZHETRF and converted by ZSYCONV.

  Arguments

  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;
          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.

  A       (input) DOUBLE COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
          obtain the factor U or L as computed by ZHETRF.

  LDA     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
          as determined by ZHETRF.

  B       (input/output) DOUBLE COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
          On exit, the solution matrix X.

  LDB     (input) INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
