  SPTCON computes the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
  1-norm) of a real symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix
  using the factorization A = L*D*L**T or A = U**T*D*U computed by
  SPTTRF.

  Norm(inv(A)) is computed by a direct method, and the reciprocal of
  the condition number is computed as
               RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

  Arguments

  N       (input) INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

  D       (input) REAL array, dimension (N)
          The n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D from the
          factorization of A, as computed by SPTTRF.

  E       (input) REAL array, dimension (N-1)
          The (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the unit bidiagonal factor
          U or L from the factorization of A,  as computed by SPTTRF.

  ANORM   (input) REAL
          The 1-norm of the original matrix A.

  RCOND   (output) REAL
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is the
          1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.

  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)

  INFO    (output) INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
