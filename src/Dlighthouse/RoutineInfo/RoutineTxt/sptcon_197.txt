  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> SPTCON computes the reciprocal of the condition number (in the 1-norm) of a real symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix using the factorization A = L*D*L**T or A = U**T*D*U computed by SPTTRF. Norm(inv(A)) is computed by a direct method, and the reciprocal of the condition number is computed as  RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
