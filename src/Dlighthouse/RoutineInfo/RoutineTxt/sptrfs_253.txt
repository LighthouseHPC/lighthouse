SPTRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
equations when the coefficient matrix is symmetric positive definite
and tridiagonal, and provides error bounds and backward error
estimates for the solution.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] D
         D is REAL array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix A.
\param[in] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix A.
\param[in] DF
         DF is REAL array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D from the
         factorization computed by SPTTRF.
\param[in] EF
         EF is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the unit bidiagonal factor
         L from the factorization computed by SPTTRF.
\param[in] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] X
         X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by SPTTRS.
         On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
         The forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
\par Internal Parameters:
 ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
