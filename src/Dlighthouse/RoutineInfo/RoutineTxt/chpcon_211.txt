  <dl class="section user"><dt>Purpose: </dt><dd><pre class="fragment"> CHPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex Hermitian packed matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H computed by CHPTRF. An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
