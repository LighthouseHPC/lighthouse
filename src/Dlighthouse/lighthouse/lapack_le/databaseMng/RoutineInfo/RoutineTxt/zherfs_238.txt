ZHERFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
equations when the coefficient matrix is Hermitian indefinite, and
provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
         upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
         of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
         is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
         triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
         the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is
         not referenced.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] AF
         AF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
         The factored form of the matrix A.  AF contains the block
         diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to obtain the
         factor U or L from the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
         A = L*D*L**H as computed by ZHETRF.
\param[in] LDAF
         LDAF is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
         as determined by ZHETRF.
\param[in] B
         B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] X
         X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by ZHETRS.
         On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
         overestimate of the true error.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
\par Internal Parameters:
 ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
