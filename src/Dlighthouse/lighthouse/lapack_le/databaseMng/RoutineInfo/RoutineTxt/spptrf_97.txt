SPPTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
positive definite matrix A stored in packed format.
The factorization has the form
   A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
   A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         See below for further details.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the
         Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, in the same
         storage format as A.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
               positive definite, and the factorization could not be
               completed.
