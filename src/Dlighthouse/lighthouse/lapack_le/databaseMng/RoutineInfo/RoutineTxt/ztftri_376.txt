ZTFTRI computes the inverse of a triangular matrix A stored in RFP
format.
This is a Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANSR
         TRANSR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  The Normal TRANSR of RFP A is stored;
         = 'C':  The Conjugate-transpose TRANSR of RFP A is stored.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
         = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
\param[in] DIAG
         DIAG is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
         = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension ( N*(N+1)/2 );
         On entry, the triangular matrix A in RFP format. RFP format
         is described by TRANSR, UPLO, and N as follows: If TRANSR =
         'N' then RFP A is (0:N,0:k-1) when N is even; k=N/2. RFP A is
         (0:N-1,0:k) when N is odd; k=N/2. IF TRANSR = 'C' then RFP is
         the Conjugate-transpose of RFP A as defined when
         TRANSR = 'N'. The contents of RFP A are defined by UPLO as
         follows: If UPLO = 'U' the RFP A contains the nt elements of
         upper packed A; If UPLO = 'L' the RFP A contains the nt
         elements of lower packed A. The LDA of RFP A is (N+1)/2 when
         TRANSR = 'C'. When TRANSR is 'N' the LDA is N+1 when N is
         even and N is odd. See the Note below for more details.
         On exit, the (triangular) inverse of the original matrix, in
         the same storage format.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = i, A(i,i) is exactly zero.  The triangular
              matrix is singular and its inverse can not be computed.
