SPTSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
A*X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite tridiagonal
matrix, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
A is factored as A = L*D*L**T, and the factored form of A is then
used to solve the system of equations.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] D
         D is REAL array, dimension (N)
         On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
         A.  On exit, the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix
         D from the factorization A = L*D*L**T.
\param[in,out] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
         matrix A.  On exit, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the
         unit bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**T factorization of
         A.  (E can also be regarded as the superdiagonal of the unit
         bidiagonal factor U from the U**T*D*U factorization of A.)
\param[in,out] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
               positive definite, and the solution has not been
               computed.  The factorization has not been completed
               unless i = N.
