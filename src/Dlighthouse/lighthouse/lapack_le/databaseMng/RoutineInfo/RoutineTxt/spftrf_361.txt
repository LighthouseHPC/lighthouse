SPFTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
positive definite matrix A.
The factorization has the form
   A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
   A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
This is the block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANSR
         TRANSR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  The Normal TRANSR of RFP A is stored;
         = 'T':  The Transpose TRANSR of RFP A is stored.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of RFP A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of RFP A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension ( N*(N+1)/2 );
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A in RFP format. RFP format is
         described by TRANSR, UPLO, and N as follows: If TRANSR = 'N'
         then RFP A is (0:N,0:k-1) when N is even; k=N/2. RFP A is
         (0:N-1,0:k) when N is odd; k=N/2. IF TRANSR = 'T' then RFP is
         the transpose of RFP A as defined when
         TRANSR = 'N'. The contents of RFP A are defined by UPLO as
         follows: If UPLO = 'U' the RFP A contains the NT elements of
         upper packed A. If UPLO = 'L' the RFP A contains the elements
         of lower packed A. The LDA of RFP A is (N+1)/2 when TRANSR =
         'T'. When TRANSR is 'N' the LDA is N+1 when N is even and N
         is odd. See the Note below for more details.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization RFP A = U**T*U or RFP A = L*L**T.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
               positive definite, and the factorization could not be
               completed.
