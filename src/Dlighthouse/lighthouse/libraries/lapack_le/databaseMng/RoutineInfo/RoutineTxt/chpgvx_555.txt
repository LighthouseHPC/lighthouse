CHPGVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A and
B are assumed to be Hermitian, stored in packed format, and B is also
positive definite.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be selected by
specifying either a range of values or a range of indices for the
desired eigenvalues.
Arguments:
\param[in] ITYPE
         ITYPE is INTEGER
         Specifies the problem type to be solved:
         = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x
         = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x
         = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] RANGE
         RANGE is CHARACTER*1
         = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found;
         = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
                will be found;
         = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the contents of AP are destroyed.
\param[in,out] BP
         BP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
         B, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of B
         is stored in the array BP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', BP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = B(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', BP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = B(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization B = U**H*U or B = L*L**H, in the same storage
         format as B.
\param[in] VL
         VL is REAL
\param[in] VU
         VU is REAL
         If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
         be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
\param[in] IL
         IL is INTEGER
\param[in] IU
         IU is INTEGER
         If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
         smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
         1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
\param[in] ABSTOL
         ABSTOL is REAL
         The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
         An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
         when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
         of width less than or equal to
                 ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
         where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
         or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
         where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
         by reducing AP to tridiagonal form.
         Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
         set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
         If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
         eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
         2*SLAMCH('S').
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
         If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
\param[out] W
         W is REAL array, dimension (N)
         On normal exit, the first M elements contain the selected
         eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] Z
         Z is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
         contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
         corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
         column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
         The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
         if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**H*B*Z = I;
         if ITYPE = 3, Z**H*inv(B)*Z = I.
         If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
         contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
         index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
         Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
         supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
         is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (7*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (5*N)
\param[out] IFAIL
         IFAIL is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
         IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
         indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  CPPTRF or CHPEVX returned an error code:
            <= N:  if INFO = i, CHPEVX failed to converge;
                   i eigenvectors failed to converge.  Their indices
                   are stored in array IFAIL.
            > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= n, then the leading
                   minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
                   The factorization of B could not be completed and
                   no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
