ZPOCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix using the
Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by ZPOTRF.
An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
         A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, as computed by ZPOTRF.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] ANORM
         ANORM is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the Hermitian matrix A.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
         estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
