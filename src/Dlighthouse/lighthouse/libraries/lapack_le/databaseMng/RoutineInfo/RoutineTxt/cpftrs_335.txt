CPFTRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a Hermitian
positive definite matrix A using the Cholesky factorization
A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by CPFTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANSR
         TRANSR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  The Normal TRANSR of RFP A is stored;
         = 'C':  The Conjugate-transpose TRANSR of RFP A is stored.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of RFP A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of RFP A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX array, dimension ( N*(N+1)/2 );
         The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
         of RFP A = U**H*U or RFP A = L*L**H, as computed by CPFTRF.
         See note below for more details about RFP A.
\param[in,out] B
         B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, the solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
