ZHEEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
of a complex Hermitian matrix A.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can
be selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
indices for the desired eigenvalues.
ZHEEVR first reduces the matrix A to tridiagonal form T with a call
to ZHETRD.  Then, whenever possible, ZHEEVR calls ZSTEMR to compute
eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations.  ZSTEMR
computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations
(also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
the various steps of the algorithm are as follows.
For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
   (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
       define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
       This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
       cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
       eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
       tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
   (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
       If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
       accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
       the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
   (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
       shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
       the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
   (d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
       the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
       factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.
The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
parameter ABSTOL.

Note 1 : ZHEEVR calls ZSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
ZHEEVR calls DSTEBZ and ZSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
when partial spectrum requests are made.
Normal execution of ZSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default
manner.

\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;

                will be found.
         = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
         For RANGE = 'V' or 'I' and IU - IL < N - 1, DSTEBZ and
         ZSTEIN are called
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
         leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
         upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
         the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
         the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
         On exit, the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') or the upper
         triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the diagonal, is
         destroyed.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] VL
         VL is DOUBLE PRECISION
\param[in] VU
         VU is DOUBLE PRECISION
         If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
         be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.

\param[in] IL
         IL is INTEGER
\param[in] IU
         IU is INTEGER
         If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
         smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
         1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
\param[in] ABSTOL
         ABSTOL is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
         An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
         when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
         of width less than or equal to
                 ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
         where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
         or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
         where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
         by reducing A to tridiagonal form.
         See "Computing Small Singular Values of Bidiagonal Matrices
         with Guaranteed High Relative Accuracy," by Demmel and
         Kahan, LAPACK Working Note #3.
         If high relative accuracy is important, set ABSTOL to
         DLAMCH( 'Safe minimum' ).  Doing so will guarantee that
         eigenvalues are computed to high relative accuracy when
         possible in future releases.  The current code does not
         make any guarantees about high relative accuracy, but
         furutre releases will. See J. Barlow and J. Demmel,
         "Computing Accurate Eigensystems of Scaled Diagonally
         Dominant Matrices", LAPACK Working Note #7, for a discussion
         of which matrices define their eigenvalues to high relative
         accuracy.
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
         If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.

         Z is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
         contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
         corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
         column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
         Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
         supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
         is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).

         is nonzero only in elements ISUPPZ( 2*i-1 ) through
         ISUPPZ( 2*i ).

         ZUNMTR as returned by ILAENV.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK and
         IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
         the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
         related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] RWORK

         The dimension of the array IWORK.  LIWORK >= max(1,10*N).
         If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
         routine only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK
         and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
         of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
         related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
