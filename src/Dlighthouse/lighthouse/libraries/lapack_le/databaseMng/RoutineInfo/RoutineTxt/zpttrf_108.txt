ZPTTRF computes the L*D*L**H factorization of a complex Hermitian
positive definite tridiagonal matrix A.  The factorization may also
be regarded as having the form A = U**H *D*U.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
         A.  On exit, the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix
         D from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.
\param[in,out] E
         E is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
         matrix A.  On exit, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the
         unit bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.
         E can also be regarded as the superdiagonal of the unit
         bidiagonal factor U from the U**H *D*U factorization of A.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = k, the leading minor of order k is not
              positive definite; if k < N, the factorization could not
              be completed, while if k = N, the factorization was
              completed, but D(N) <= 0.
