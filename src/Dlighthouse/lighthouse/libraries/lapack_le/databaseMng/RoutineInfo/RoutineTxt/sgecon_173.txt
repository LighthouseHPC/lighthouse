SGECON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a general
real matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm, using
the LU factorization computed by SGETRF.
An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as
   RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
Arguments:
\param[in] NORM
         NORM is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
         infinity-norm condition number is required:
         = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
         = 'I':         Infinity-norm.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
         as computed by SGETRF.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] ANORM
         ANORM is REAL
         If NORM = '1' or 'O', the 1-norm of the original matrix A.
         If NORM = 'I', the infinity-norm of the original matrix A.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is REAL
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (4*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
