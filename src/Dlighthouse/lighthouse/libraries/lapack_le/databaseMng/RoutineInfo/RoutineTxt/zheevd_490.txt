ZHEEVD computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
complex Hermitian matrix A.  If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a
divide and conquer algorithm.
The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
without guard digits, but we know of none.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
         leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
         upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
         the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
         the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
         On exit, if JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, A contains the
         orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then on exit the lower triangle (if UPLO='L')
         or the upper triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the
         diagonal, is destroyed.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] W
         W is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The length of the array WORK.
         If N <= 1,                LWORK must be at least 1.
         If JOBZ  = 'N' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least N + 1.
         If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least 2*N + N**2.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK and
         IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
         the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
         related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array,
                                        dimension (LRWORK)
         On exit, if INFO = 0, RWORK(1) returns the optimal LRWORK.
\param[in] LRWORK
         LRWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array RWORK.
         If N <= 1,                LRWORK must be at least 1.
         If JOBZ  = 'N' and N > 1, LRWORK must be at least N.
         If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LRWORK must be at least
                        1 + 5*N + 2*N**2.
         If LRWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
         routine only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK
         and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
         of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
         related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LIWORK.
\param[in] LIWORK
         LIWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array IWORK.
         If N <= 1,                LIWORK must be at least 1.
         If JOBZ  = 'N' and N > 1, LIWORK must be at least 1.
         If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LIWORK must be at least 3 + 5*N.
         If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
         routine only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK
         and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
         of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
         related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i and JOBZ = 'N', then the algorithm failed
               to converge; i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
               tridiagonal form did not converge to zero;
               if INFO = i and JOBZ = 'V', then the algorithm failed
               to compute an eigenvalue while working on the submatrix
               lying in rows and columns INFO/(N+1) through
               mod(INFO,N+1).
