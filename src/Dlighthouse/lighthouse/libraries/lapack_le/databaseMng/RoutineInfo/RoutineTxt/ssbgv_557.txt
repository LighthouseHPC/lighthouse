SSBGV computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite banded eigenproblem, of
the form A*x=(lambda)*B*x. Here A and B are assumed to be symmetric
and banded, and B is also positive definite.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KA
         KA is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'. KA >= 0.
\param[in] KB
         KB is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix B if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'. KB >= 0.
\param[in,out] AB
         AB is REAL array, dimension (LDAB, N)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
         matrix A, stored in the first ka+1 rows of the array.  The
         j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(ka+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ka)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+ka).
         On exit, the contents of AB are destroyed.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KA+1.
\param[in,out] BB
         BB is REAL array, dimension (LDBB, N)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
         matrix B, stored in the first kb+1 rows of the array.  The
         j-th column of B is stored in the j-th column of the array BB
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', BB(kb+1+i-j,j) = B(i,j) for max(1,j-kb)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', BB(1+i-j,j)    = B(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kb).
         On exit, the factor S from the split Cholesky factorization
         B = S**T*S, as returned by SPBSTF.
\param[in] LDBB
         LDBB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array BB.  LDBB >= KB+1.
\param[out] W
         W is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] Z
         Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the matrix Z of
         eigenvectors, with the i-th column of Z holding the
         eigenvector associated with W(i). The eigenvectors are
         normalized so that Z**T*B*Z = I.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (3*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is:
            <= N:  the algorithm failed to converge:
                   i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
                   tridiagonal form did not converge to zero;
            > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= N, then SPBSTF
                   returned INFO = i: B is not positive definite.
                   The factorization of B could not be completed and
                   no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
