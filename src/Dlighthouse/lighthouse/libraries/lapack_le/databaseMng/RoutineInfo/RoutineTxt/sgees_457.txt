SGEES computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
eigenvalues, the real Schur form T, and, optionally, the matrix of
Schur vectors Z.  This gives the Schur factorization A = Z*T*(Z**T).
Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues on the diagonal of the
real Schur form so that selected eigenvalues are at the top left.
The leading columns of Z then form an orthonormal basis for the
invariant subspace corresponding to the selected eigenvalues.
A matrix is in real Schur form if it is upper quasi-triangular with
1-by-1 and 2-by-2 blocks. 2-by-2 blocks will be standardized in the
form
        [  a  b  ]
        [  c  a  ]
where b*c < 0. The eigenvalues of such a block are a +- sqrt(bc).
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBVS
         JOBVS is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': Schur vectors are not computed;
         = 'V': Schur vectors are computed.
\param[in] SORT
         SORT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not to order the eigenvalues on the
         diagonal of the Schur form.
         = 'N': Eigenvalues are not ordered;
         = 'S': Eigenvalues are ordered (see SELECT).
\param[in] SELECT
         SELECT is LOGICAL FUNCTION of two REAL arguments
         SELECT must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling subroutine.
         If SORT = 'S', SELECT is used to select eigenvalues to sort
         to the top left of the Schur form.
         If SORT = 'N', SELECT is not referenced.
         An eigenvalue WR(j)+sqrt(-1)*WI(j) is selected if
         SELECT(WR(j),WI(j)) is true; i.e., if either one of a complex
         conjugate pair of eigenvalues is selected, then both complex
         eigenvalues are selected.
         Note that a selected complex eigenvalue may no longer
         satisfy SELECT(WR(j),WI(j)) = .TRUE. after ordering, since
         ordering may change the value of complex eigenvalues
         (especially if the eigenvalue is ill-conditioned); in this
         case INFO is set to N+2 (see INFO below).
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
         On exit, A has been overwritten by its real Schur form T.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] SDIM
         SDIM is INTEGER
         If SORT = 'N', SDIM = 0.
         If SORT = 'S', SDIM = number of eigenvalues (after sorting)
                        for which SELECT is true. (Complex conjugate
                        pairs for which SELECT is true for either
                        eigenvalue count as 2.)
\param[out] WR
         WR is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] WI
         WI is REAL array, dimension (N)
         WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts,
         respectively, of the computed eigenvalues in the same order
         that they appear on the diagonal of the output Schur form T.
         Complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues will appear
         consecutively with the eigenvalue having the positive
         imaginary part first.
\param[out] VS
         VS is REAL array, dimension (LDVS,N)
         If JOBVS = 'V', VS contains the orthogonal matrix Z of Schur
         vectors.
         If JOBVS = 'N', VS is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVS
         LDVS is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VS.  LDVS >= 1; if
         JOBVS = 'V', LDVS >= N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) contains the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,3*N).
         For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] BWORK
         BWORK is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         Not referenced if SORT = 'N'.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
            <= N: the QR algorithm failed to compute all the
                  eigenvalues; elements 1:ILO-1 and i+1:N of WR and WI
                  contain those eigenvalues which have converged; if
                  JOBVS = 'V', VS contains the matrix which reduces A
                  to its partially converged Schur form.
            = N+1: the eigenvalues could not be reordered because some
                  eigenvalues were too close to separate (the problem
                  is very ill-conditioned);
            = N+2: after reordering, roundoff changed values of some
                  complex eigenvalues so that leading eigenvalues in
                  the Schur form no longer satisfy SELECT=.TRUE.  This
                  could also be caused by underflow due to scaling.
