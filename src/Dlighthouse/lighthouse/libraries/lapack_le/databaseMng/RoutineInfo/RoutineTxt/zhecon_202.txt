ZHECON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex
Hermitian matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
A = L*D*L**H computed by ZHETRF.
An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
         as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
         = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
         obtain the factor U or L as computed by ZHETRF.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
         as determined by ZHETRF.
\param[in] ANORM
         ANORM is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The 1-norm of the original matrix A.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
         estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
