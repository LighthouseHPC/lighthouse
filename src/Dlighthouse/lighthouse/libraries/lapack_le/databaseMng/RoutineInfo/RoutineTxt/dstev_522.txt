DSTEV computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
real symmetric tridiagonal matrix A.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
         A.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[in,out] E
         E is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
         matrix A, stored in elements 1 to N-1 of E.
         On exit, the contents of E are destroyed.
\param[out] Z
         Z is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the orthonormal
         eigenvectors of the matrix A, with the i-th column of Z
         holding the eigenvector associated with D(i).
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (max(1,2*N-2))
         If JOBZ = 'N', WORK is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the algorithm failed to converge; i
               off-diagonal elements of E did not converge to zero.
