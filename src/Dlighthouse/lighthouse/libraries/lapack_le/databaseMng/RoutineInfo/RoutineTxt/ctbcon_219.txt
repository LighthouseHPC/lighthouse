CTBCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a
triangular band matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.
The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
computed as
   RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
Arguments:
\param[in] NORM
         NORM is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
         infinity-norm condition number is required:
         = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
         = 'I':         Infinity-norm.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
         = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
\param[in] DIAG
         DIAG is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
         = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals or subdiagonals of the
         triangular band matrix A.  KD >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         The upper or lower triangular band matrix A, stored in the
         first kd+1 rows of the array. The j-th column of A is stored
         in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
         If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
         and are assumed to be 1.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is REAL
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
