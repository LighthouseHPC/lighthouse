DSYSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
matrices.
Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
provided.
\par Description:
The following steps are performed:
1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A.
   The form of the factorization is
      A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
      A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
   where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
   triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
   1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
   returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
   to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
   reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
   INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
   to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
   of A.
4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
   matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
   for it.
Arguments:
\param[in] FACT
         FACT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not the factored form of A has been
         supplied on entry.
         = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of
                 A.  AF and IPIV will not be modified.
         = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
         matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
         upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
         of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
         is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
         triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
         the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is
         not referenced.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] AF
         AF is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
         If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
         contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
         to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
         A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by DSYTRF.
         If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
         returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
         to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
         A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T.
\param[in] LDAF
         LDAF is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
         contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
         of D, as determined by DSYTRF.
         If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
         If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
         columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
         is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
         IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
         If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
         contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
         of D, as determined by DSYTRF.
\param[in] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] X
         X is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
         A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
         particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
         precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
         INFO > 0.
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
         overestimate of the true error.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The length of WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,3*N), and for best
         performance, when FACT = 'N', LWORK >= max(1,3*N,N*NB), where
         NB is the optimal blocksize for DSYTRF.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
               <= N:  D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                      has been completed but the factor D is exactly
                      singular, so the solution and error bounds could
                      not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
               = N+1: D is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                      precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                      to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                      solution and error bounds are computed because
                      there are a number of situations where the
                      computed solution can be more accurate than the
                      value of RCOND would suggest.
