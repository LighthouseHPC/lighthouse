CPBTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a complex Hermitian
positive definite band matrix A.
The factorization has the form
   A = U**H * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
   A = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
\param[in,out] AB
         AB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band
         matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
         j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the
         Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the band
         matrix A, in the same storage format as A.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
               positive definite, and the factorization could not be
               completed.

\par Further Details:
 The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
 N = 6, KD = 2, and UPLO = 'U':
 On entry:                       On exit:
     *    *   a13  a24  a35  a46      *    *   u13  u24  u35  u46
     *   a12  a23  a34  a45  a56      *   u12  u23  u34  u45  u56
    a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66     u11  u22  u33  u44  u55  u66
 Similarly, if UPLO = 'L' the format of A is as follows:
 On entry:                       On exit:
    a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66     l11  l22  l33  l44  l55  l66
    a21  a32  a43  a54  a65   *      l21  l32  l43  l54  l65   *
    a31  a42  a53  a64   *    *      l31  l42  l53  l64   *    *
 Array elements marked * are not used by the routine.
