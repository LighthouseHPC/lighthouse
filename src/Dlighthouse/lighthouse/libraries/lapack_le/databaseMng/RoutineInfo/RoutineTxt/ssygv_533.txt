SSYGV computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.
Here A and B are assumed to be symmetric and B is also
positive definite.
Arguments:
\param[in] ITYPE
         ITYPE is INTEGER
         Specifies the problem type to be solved:
         = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x
         = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x
         = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
         leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
         upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
         the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
         the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
         On exit, if JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, A contains the
         matrix Z of eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors are normalized
         as follows:
         if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**T*B*Z = I;
         if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then on exit the upper triangle (if UPLO='U')
         or the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') of A, including the
         diagonal, is destroyed.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB, N)
         On entry, the symmetric positive definite matrix B.
         If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of B
         contains the upper triangular part of the matrix B.
         If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of B
         contains the lower triangular part of the matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO <= N, the part of B containing the matrix is
         overwritten by the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization B = U**T*U or B = L*L**T.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] W
         W is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,3*N-1).
         For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+2)*N,
         where NB is the blocksize for SSYTRD returned by ILAENV.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  SPOTRF or SSYEV returned an error code:
            <= N:  if INFO = i, SSYEV failed to converge;
                   i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
                   tridiagonal form did not converge to zero;
            > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= N, then the leading
                   minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
                   The factorization of B could not be completed and
                   no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
