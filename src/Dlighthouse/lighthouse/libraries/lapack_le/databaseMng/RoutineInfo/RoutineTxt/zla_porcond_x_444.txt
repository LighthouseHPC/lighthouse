   ZLA_PORCOND_X Computes the infinity norm condition number of
   op(A) * diag(X) where X is a COMPLEX*16 vector.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
      = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
      = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
    The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
    matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
    On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] AF
         AF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
    The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
    A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, as computed by ZPOTRF.
\param[in] LDAF
         LDAF is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
\param[in] X
         X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
    The vector X in the formula op(A) * diag(X).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
      = 0:  Successful exit.
    i > 0:  The ith argument is invalid.
\param[in] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N).
    Workspace.
\param[in] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N).
    Workspace.
