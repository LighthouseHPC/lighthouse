CHPEV computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
complex Hermitian matrix in packed storage.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, AP is overwritten by values generated during the
         reduction to tridiagonal form.  If UPLO = 'U', the diagonal
         and first superdiagonal of the tridiagonal matrix T overwrite
         the corresponding elements of A, and if UPLO = 'L', the
         diagonal and first subdiagonal of T overwrite the
         corresponding elements of A.
\param[out] W
         W is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] Z
         Z is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the orthonormal
         eigenvectors of the matrix A, with the i-th column of Z
         holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (max(1, 2*N-1))
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (max(1, 3*N-2))
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit.
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the algorithm failed to converge; i
               off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal
               form did not converge to zero.
