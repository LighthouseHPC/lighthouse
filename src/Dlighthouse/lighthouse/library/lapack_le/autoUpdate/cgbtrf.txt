\par Purpose:
=============
\verbatim
CGBTRF computes an LU factorization of a complex m-by-n band matrix A
using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
\endverbatim
Arguments:
==========
\param[in] M
\verbatim
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
\endverbatim
\param[in] N
\verbatim
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\endverbatim
\param[in] KL
\verbatim
         KL is INTEGER
         The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
\endverbatim
\param[in] KU
\verbatim
         KU is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
\endverbatim
\param[in,out] AB
\verbatim
         AB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
         2*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
         The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
         array AB as follows:
         AB(kl+ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl)
         On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an
         upper triangular band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in
         rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
         factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
         See below for further details.
\endverbatim
\param[in] LDAB
\verbatim
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
\endverbatim
\param[out] IPIV
\verbatim
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
         The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
         matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\endverbatim
\param[out] INFO
\verbatim
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = +i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
              has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
              singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
              to solve a system of equations.
