CGBSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
A * X = B, where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals
and KU superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is
used to factor A as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation
and unit lower triangular matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is
upper triangular with KL+KU superdiagonals.  The factored form of A
is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
         matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KL
         KL is INTEGER
         The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
\param[in] KU
         KU is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] AB
         AB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
         2*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
         The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
         array AB as follows:
         AB(KL+KU+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KU)<=i<=min(N,j+KL)
         On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an
         upper triangular band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in
         rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
         factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
         See below for further details.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices that define the permutation matrix P;
         row i of the matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[in,out] B
         B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
               singular, and the solution has not been computed.
