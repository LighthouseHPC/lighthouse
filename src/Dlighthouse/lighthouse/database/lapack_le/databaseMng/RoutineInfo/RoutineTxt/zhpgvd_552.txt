ZHPGVD computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors
of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A and
B are assumed to be Hermitian, stored in packed format, and B is also
positive definite.
If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.
The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
without guard digits, but we know of none.
Arguments:
\param[in] ITYPE
         ITYPE is INTEGER
         Specifies the problem type to be solved:
         = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x
         = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x
         = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the contents of AP are destroyed.
\param[in,out] BP
         BP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
         B, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of B
         is stored in the array BP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', BP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = B(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', BP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = B(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization B = U**H*U or B = L*L**H, in the same storage
         format as B.

         If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] Z
         Z is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the matrix Z of
         eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
         if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**H*B*Z = I;
         if ITYPE = 3, Z**H*inv(B)*Z = I.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the required LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.
         If N <= 1,               LWORK >= 1.
         If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LWORK >= N.
         If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK >= 2*N.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the required sizes of the WORK, RWORK and
         IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
         the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
         related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LRWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, RWORK(1) returns the required LRWORK.
\param[in] LRWORK
         LRWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of array RWORK.
         If N <= 1,               LRWORK >= 1.
         If JOBZ = 'N' and N > 1, LRWORK >= N.
         If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LRWORK >= 1 + 5*N + 2*N**2.
         If LRWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
         routine only calculates the required sizes of the WORK, RWORK
         and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
         of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
         related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (MAX(1,LIWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the required LIWORK.
\param[in] LIWORK
         LIWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of array IWORK.
         If JOBZ  = 'N' or N <= 1, LIWORK >= 1.
         If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LIWORK >= 3 + 5*N.
         If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
         routine only calculates the required sizes of the WORK, RWORK
         and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
         of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
         related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  ZPPTRF or ZHPEVD returned an error code:
            <= N:  if INFO = i, ZHPEVD failed to converge;
                   i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
                   tridiagonal form did not convergeto zero;
            > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= n, then the leading
                   minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
                   The factorization of B could not be completed and
                   no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
