DGGEV computes for a pair of N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrices (A,B)
the generalized eigenvalues, and optionally, the left and/or right
generalized eigenvectors.
A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar
lambda or a ratio alpha/beta = lambda, such that A - lambda*B is
singular. It is usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as
there is a reasonable interpretation for beta=0, and even for both
being zero.
The right eigenvector v(j) corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda(j)
of (A,B) satisfies
                 A * v(j) = lambda(j) * B * v(j).
The left eigenvector u(j) corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda(j)
of (A,B) satisfies
                 u(j)**H * A  = lambda(j) * u(j)**H * B .
where u(j)**H is the conjugate-transpose of u(j).
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBVL
         JOBVL is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the left generalized eigenvectors;
         = 'V':  compute the left generalized eigenvectors.
\param[in] JOBVR
         JOBVR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the right generalized eigenvectors;
         = 'V':  compute the right generalized eigenvectors.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A, B, VL, and VR.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the matrix A in the pair (A,B).
         On exit, A has been overwritten.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB, N)
         On entry, the matrix B in the pair (A,B).
         On exit, B has been overwritten.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] ALPHAR
         ALPHAR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] ALPHAI
         ALPHAI is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
\param[out] BETA
         BETA is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         On exit, (ALPHAR(j) + ALPHAI(j)*i)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will
         be the generalized eigenvalues.  If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then
         the j-th eigenvalue is real; if positive, then the j-th and
         (j+1)-st eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair, with
         ALPHAI(j+1) negative.
         Note: the quotients ALPHAR(j)/BETA(j) and ALPHAI(j)/BETA(j)
         may easily over- or underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.
         Thus, the user should avoid naively computing the ratio
         alpha/beta.  However, ALPHAR and ALPHAI will be always less
         than and usually comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and
         BETA always less than and usually comparable with norm(B).
\param[out] VL
         VL is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVL,N)
         If JOBVL = 'V', the left eigenvectors u(j) are stored one
         after another in the columns of VL, in the same order as
         their eigenvalues. If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then
         u(j) = VL(:,j), the j-th column of VL. If the j-th and
         (j+1)-th eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair, then
         u(j) = VL(:,j)+i*VL(:,j+1) and u(j+1) = VL(:,j)-i*VL(:,j+1).
         Each eigenvector is scaled so the largest component has
         abs(real part)+abs(imag. part)=1.
         Not referenced if JOBVL = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VL. LDVL >= 1, and
         if JOBVL = 'V', LDVL >= N.
\param[out] VR
         VR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVR,N)
         If JOBVR = 'V', the right eigenvectors v(j) are stored one
         after another in the columns of VR, in the same order as
         their eigenvalues. If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then
         v(j) = VR(:,j), the j-th column of VR. If the j-th and
         (j+1)-th eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair, then
         v(j) = VR(:,j)+i*VR(:,j+1) and v(j+1) = VR(:,j)-i*VR(:,j+1).
         Each eigenvector is scaled so the largest component has
         abs(real part)+abs(imag. part)=1.
         Not referenced if JOBVR = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VR. LDVR >= 1, and
         if JOBVR = 'V', LDVR >= N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,8*N).
         For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         = 1,...,N:
               The QZ iteration failed.  No eigenvectors have been
               calculated, but ALPHAR(j), ALPHAI(j), and BETA(j)
               should be correct for j=INFO+1,...,N.
         > N:  =N+1: other than QZ iteration failed in DHGEQZ.
               =N+2: error return from DTGEVC.
