Subspace Iteration (or Simultaneous Iteration) is a simple method for approximating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices. It can be seen as a generalization of the Power Method, in the sense that it iterates simultaneously on m initial vectors, instead of just one.  

The algorithm computes a set of dominant Schur vectors, from which the eigenvectors are computed afterwards.
