The method of Lanczos[1950] has become one of the most successful methods for approximating a few eigenvalues of a real symmetric (or complex Hermitian) matrix.

The Lanczos method is related to the Arnoldi method in the sense that Lanczos can be seen as a particular case of Arnoldi when the matrix is symmetric. 

The  Lanczos  method  can  be  derived  from  different  points  of  view.   One  such perspective  is the reduction of an nxn symmetric matrix A to tridiagonal form by means of a three-term recurrence  formula.
