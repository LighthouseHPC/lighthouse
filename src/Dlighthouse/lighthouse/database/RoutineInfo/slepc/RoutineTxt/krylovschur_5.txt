The Krylov-Schur method was introduced in 2001 by Stewart and can be seen as an improvement on  traditional Krylov subspace methods such as Arnoldi and Lanczos. More  precisely, the Krylov-Schur method incorporates an effective and robust restarting scheme, resulting in fast convergence in most cases.
