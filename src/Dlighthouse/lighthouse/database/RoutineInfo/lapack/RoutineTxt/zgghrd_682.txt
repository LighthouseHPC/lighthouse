ZGGHRD reduces a pair of complex matrices (A,B) to generalized upper
Hessenberg form using unitary transformations, where A is a
general matrix and B is upper triangular.  The form of the
generalized eigenvalue problem is
   A*x = lambda*B*x,
and B is typically made upper triangular by computing its QR
factorization and moving the unitary matrix Q to the left side
of the equation.
This subroutine simultaneously reduces A to a Hessenberg matrix H:
   Q**H*A*Z = H
and transforms B to another upper triangular matrix T:
   Q**H*B*Z = T
in order to reduce the problem to its standard form
   H*y = lambda*T*y
where y = Z**H*x.
The unitary matrices Q and Z are determined as products of Givens
rotations.  They may either be formed explicitly, or they may be
postmultiplied into input matrices Q1 and Z1, so that
     Q1 * A * Z1**H = (Q1*Q) * H * (Z1*Z)**H
     Q1 * B * Z1**H = (Q1*Q) * T * (Z1*Z)**H
If Q1 is the unitary matrix from the QR factorization of B in the
original equation A*x = lambda*B*x, then ZGGHRD reduces the original
problem to generalized Hessenberg form.

         COMPQ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': do not compute Q;

                unitary matrix Q is returned;
         = 'V': Q must contain a unitary matrix Q1 on entry,
                and the product Q1*Q is returned.
\param[in] COMPZ
         COMPZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': do not compute Q;
         = 'I': Q is initialized to the unit matrix, and the
                unitary matrix Q is returned;

\param[in] IHI
         IHI is INTEGER
         ILO and IHI mark the rows and columns of A which are to be

         normally set by a previous call to ZGGBAL; otherwise they
         should be set to 1 and N respectively.
         1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N, if N > 0; ILO=1 and IHI=0, if N=0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the N-by-N general matrix to be reduced.
         On exit, the upper triangle and the first subdiagonal of A
         are overwritten with the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and the
         rest is set to zero.

         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

         B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB, N)
         On entry, the N-by-N upper triangular matrix B.
         On exit, the upper triangular matrix T = Q**H B Z.  The
         elements below the diagonal are set to zero.

\param[in,out] Q
         Q is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDQ, N)
         On entry, if COMPQ = 'V', the unitary matrix Q1, typically
         from the QR factorization of B.
         On exit, if COMPQ='I', the unitary matrix Q, and if
         COMPQ = 'V', the product Q1*Q.
         Not referenced if COMPQ='N'.
\param[in] LDQ
         LDQ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Q.
         LDQ >= N if COMPQ='V' or 'I'; LDQ >= 1 otherwise.
\param[in,out] Z
         Z is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         On entry, if COMPZ = 'V', the unitary matrix Z1.

\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.
         LDZ >= N if COMPZ='V' or 'I'; LDZ >= 1 otherwise.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit.
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
