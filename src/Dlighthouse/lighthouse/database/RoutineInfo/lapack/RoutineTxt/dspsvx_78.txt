DSPSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization A = U*D*U**T or
A = L*D*L**T to compute the solution to a real system of linear
equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix stored
in packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
provided.
\par Description:
The following steps are performed:
1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
      A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
      A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
   where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
   triangular matrices and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
   1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
   returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
   to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
   reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
   INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
   to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.
3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
   of A.
4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
   matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
   for it.
Arguments:
\param[in] FACT
         FACT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not the factored form of A has been
         supplied on entry.
         = 'F':  On entry, AFP and IPIV contain the factored form of
                 A.  AP, AFP and IPIV will not be modified.
         = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AFP and factored.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
         matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] AP
         AP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         The upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix A, packed
         columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored
         in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         See below for further details.
\param[in,out] AFP
         AFP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
                           (N*(N+1)/2)
         If FACT = 'F', then AFP is an input argument and on entry
         contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
         to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
         A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by DSPTRF, stored as
         a packed triangular matrix in the same storage format as A.
         If FACT = 'N', then AFP is an output argument and on exit
         contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
         to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization
         A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by DSPTRF, stored as
         a packed triangular matrix in the same storage format as A.
\param[in,out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
         contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
         of D, as determined by DSPTRF.
         If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
         If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
         columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
         is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
         IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
         If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
         contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
         of D, as determined by DSPTRF.
\param[in] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] X
         X is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         If INFO = 0 or INFO = N+1, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
         A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
         particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
         precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
         INFO > 0.
\param[out] FERR
         FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
         overestimate of the true error.
\param[out] BERR
         BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
               <= N:  D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                      has been completed but the factor D is exactly
                      singular, so the solution and error bounds could
                      not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
               = N+1: D is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                      precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                      to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                      solution and error bounds are computed because
                      there are a number of situations where the
                      computed solution can be more accurate than the
                      value of RCOND would suggest.
