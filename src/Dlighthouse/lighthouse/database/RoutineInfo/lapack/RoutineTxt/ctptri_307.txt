CTPTRI computes the inverse of a complex upper or lower triangular
matrix A stored in packed format.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
         = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
\param[in] DIAG
         DIAG is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
         = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangular matrix A, stored
         columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored
         in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*((2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         See below for further details.
         On exit, the (triangular) inverse of the original matrix, in
         the same packed storage format.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, A(i,i) is exactly zero.  The triangular
               matrix is singular and its inverse can not be computed.

\par Further Details:
 A triangular matrix A can be transferred to packed storage using one
 of the following program segments:
 UPLO = 'U':                      UPLO = 'L':
       JC = 1                           JC = 1
       DO 2 J = 1, N                    DO 2 J = 1, N
          DO 1 I = 1, J                    DO 1 I = J, N
             AP(JC+I-1) = A(I,J)              AP(JC+I-J) = A(I,J)
     1    CONTINUE                    1    CONTINUE
          JC = JC + J                      JC = JC + N - J + 1
     2 CONTINUE                       2 CONTINUE
