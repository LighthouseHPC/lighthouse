SGEBRD reduces a general real M-by-N matrix A to upper or lower
bidiagonal form B by an orthogonal transformation: Q**T * A * P = B.
If m >= n, B is upper bidiagonal; if m < n, B is lower bidiagonal.
Arguments:
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows in the matrix A.  M >= 0.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns in the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the M-by-N general matrix to be reduced.
         On exit,
         if m >= n, the diagonal and the first superdiagonal are
           overwritten with the upper bidiagonal matrix B; the
           elements below the diagonal, with the array TAUQ, represent
           the orthogonal matrix Q as a product of elementary
           reflectors, and the elements above the first superdiagonal,
           with the array TAUP, represent the orthogonal matrix P as
           a product of elementary reflectors;
         if m < n, the diagonal and the first subdiagonal are
           overwritten with the lower bidiagonal matrix B; the
           elements below the first subdiagonal, with the array TAUQ,
           represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product of
           elementary reflectors, and the elements above the diagonal,
           with the array TAUP, represent the orthogonal matrix P as
           a product of elementary reflectors.
         See Further Details.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
\param[out] D
         D is REAL array, dimension (min(M,N))
         The diagonal elements of the bidiagonal matrix B:
         D(i) = A(i,i).
\param[out] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (min(M,N)-1)
         The off-diagonal elements of the bidiagonal matrix B:
         if m >= n, E(i) = A(i,i+1) for i = 1,2,...,n-1;
         if m < n, E(i) = A(i+1,i) for i = 1,2,...,m-1.
\param[out] TAUQ
         TAUQ is REAL array dimension (min(M,N))
         The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors which
         represent the orthogonal matrix Q. See Further Details.
\param[out] TAUP
         TAUP is REAL array, dimension (min(M,N))
         The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors which
         represent the orthogonal matrix P. See Further Details.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,M,N).
         For optimum performance LWORK >= (M+N)*NB, where NB
         is the optimal blocksize.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit 
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.

\par Further Details:
 The matrices Q and P are represented as products of elementary
 reflectors:
 If m >= n,
    Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n)  and  P = G(1) G(2) . . . G(n-1)
 Each H(i) and G(i) has the form:
    H(i) = I - tauq * v * v**T  and G(i) = I - taup * u * u**T
 where tauq and taup are real scalars, and v and u are real vectors;
 v(1:i-1) = 0, v(i) = 1, and v(i+1:m) is stored on exit in A(i+1:m,i);
 u(1:i) = 0, u(i+1) = 1, and u(i+2:n) is stored on exit in A(i,i+2:n);
 tauq is stored in TAUQ(i) and taup in TAUP(i).
 If m < n,
    Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(m-1)  and  P = G(1) G(2) . . . G(m)
 Each H(i) and G(i) has the form:
    H(i) = I - tauq * v * v**T  and G(i) = I - taup * u * u**T
 where tauq and taup are real scalars, and v and u are real vectors;
 v(1:i) = 0, v(i+1) = 1, and v(i+2:m) is stored on exit in A(i+2:m,i);
 u(1:i-1) = 0, u(i) = 1, and u(i+1:n) is stored on exit in A(i,i+1:n);
 tauq is stored in TAUQ(i) and taup in TAUP(i).
 The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples:
 m = 6 and n = 5 (m > n):          m = 5 and n = 6 (m < n):
   (  d   e   u1  u1  u1 )           (  d   u1  u1  u1  u1  u1 )
   (  v1  d   e   u2  u2 )           (  e   d   u2  u2  u2  u2 )
   (  v1  v2  d   e   u3 )           (  v1  e   d   u3  u3  u3 )
   (  v1  v2  v3  d   e  )           (  v1  v2  e   d   u4  u4 )
   (  v1  v2  v3  v4  d  )           (  v1  v2  v3  e   d   u5 )
   (  v1  v2  v3  v4  v5 )
 where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of B, vi
 denotes an element of the vector defining H(i), and ui an element of
 the vector defining G(i).
