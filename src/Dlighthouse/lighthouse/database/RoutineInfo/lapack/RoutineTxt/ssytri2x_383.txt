SSYTRI2X computes the inverse of a real symmetric indefinite matrix
A using the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by
SSYTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
         as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
         = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the NNB diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
         used to obtain the factor U or L as computed by SSYTRF.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the (symmetric) inverse of the original
         matrix.  If UPLO = 'U', the upper triangular part of the
         inverse is formed and the part of A below the diagonal is not
         referenced; if UPLO = 'L' the lower triangular part of the
         inverse is formed and the part of A above the diagonal is
         not referenced.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the NNB structure of D
         as determined by SSYTRF.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (N+NNB+1,NNB+3)
\param[in] NB
         NB is INTEGER
         Block size
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) = 0; the matrix is singular and its
              inverse could not be computed.
