DPTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix by first factoring the
matrix using DPTTRF, and then calling DBDSQR to compute the singular
values of the bidiagonal factor.
This routine computes the eigenvalues of the positive definite
tridiagonal matrix to high relative accuracy.  This means that if the
eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude in size, then the
small eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will be computed
more accurately than, for example, with the standard QR method.
The eigenvectors of a full or band symmetric positive definite matrix
can also be found if DSYTRD, DSPTRD, or DSBTRD has been used to
reduce this matrix to tridiagonal form. (The reduction to tridiagonal
form, however, may preclude the possibility of obtaining high
relative accuracy in the small eigenvalues of the original matrix, if
these eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude.)
Arguments:
\param[in] COMPZ
         COMPZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvectors of original symmetric
                 matrix also.  Array Z contains the orthogonal
                 matrix used to reduce the original matrix to
                 tridiagonal form.
         = 'I':  Compute eigenvectors of tridiagonal matrix also.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal
         matrix.
         On normal exit, D contains the eigenvalues, in descending
         order.
\param[in,out] E
         E is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
         matrix.
         On exit, E has been destroyed.
\param[in,out] Z
         Z is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         On entry, if COMPZ = 'V', the orthogonal matrix used in the
         reduction to tridiagonal form.
         On exit, if COMPZ = 'V', the orthonormal eigenvectors of the
         original symmetric matrix;
         if COMPZ = 'I', the orthonormal eigenvectors of the
         tridiagonal matrix.
         If INFO > 0 on exit, Z contains the eigenvectors associated
         with only the stored eigenvalues.
         If  COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         COMPZ = 'V' or 'I', LDZ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (4*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit.
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is:
               <= N  the Cholesky factorization of the matrix could
                     not be performed because the i-th principal minor
                     was not positive definite.
               > N   the SVD algorithm failed to converge;
                     if INFO = N+i, i off-diagonal elements of the
                     bidiagonal factor did not converge to zero.
