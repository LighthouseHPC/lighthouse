SSYGST reduces a real symmetric-definite generalized eigenproblem
to standard form.
If ITYPE = 1, the problem is A*x = lambda*B*x,
and A is overwritten by inv(U**T)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**T)
If ITYPE = 2 or 3, the problem is A*B*x = lambda*x or
B*A*x = lambda*x, and A is overwritten by U*A*U**T or L**T*A*L.
B must have been previously factorized as U**T*U or L*L**T by SPOTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] ITYPE
         ITYPE is INTEGER
         = 1: compute inv(U**T)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**T);
         = 2 or 3: compute U*A*U**T or L**T*A*L.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
                 U**T*U;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
                 L*L**T.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
         N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
         leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
         triangular part of A is not referenced.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the transformed matrix, stored in the
         same format as A.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,N)
         The triangular factor from the Cholesky factorization of B,
         as returned by SPOTRF.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
