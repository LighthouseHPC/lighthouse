CGBTRF computes an LU factorization of a complex m-by-n band matrix A
using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
Arguments:
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KL
         KL is INTEGER
         The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
\param[in] KU
         KU is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
\param[in,out] AB
         AB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
         2*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
         The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
         array AB as follows:
         AB(kl+ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl)
         On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an
         upper triangular band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in
         rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
         factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
         See below for further details.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
         The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
         matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = +i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
              has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
              singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
              to solve a system of equations.

\par Further Details:
 The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
 M = N = 6, KL = 2, KU = 1:
 On entry:                       On exit:
     *    *    *    +    +    +       *    *    *   u14  u25  u36
     *    *    +    +    +    +       *    *   u13  u24  u35  u46
     *   a12  a23  a34  a45  a56      *   u12  u23  u34  u45  u56
    a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66     u11  u22  u33  u44  u55  u66
    a21  a32  a43  a54  a65   *      m21  m32  m43  m54  m65   *
    a31  a42  a53  a64   *    *      m31  m42  m53  m64   *    *
 Array elements marked * are not used by the routine; elements marked
 + need not be set on entry, but are required by the routine to store
 elements of U because of fill-in resulting from the row interchanges.
