SGGEVX computes for a pair of N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrices (A,B)
the generalized eigenvalues, and optionally, the left and/or right
generalized eigenvectors.
Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
LSCALE, RSCALE, ABNRM, and BBNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for
the eigenvalues (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the
right eigenvectors (RCONDV).
A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar
lambda or a ratio alpha/beta = lambda, such that A - lambda*B is
singular. It is usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as
there is a reasonable interpretation for beta=0, and even for both
being zero.
The right eigenvector v(j) corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda(j)
of (A,B) satisfies
                 A * v(j) = lambda(j) * B * v(j) .
The left eigenvector u(j) corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda(j)
of (A,B) satisfies
                 u(j)**H * A  = lambda(j) * u(j)**H * B.
where u(j)**H is the conjugate-transpose of u(j).
Arguments:
\param[in] BALANC
         BALANC is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the balance option to be performed.
         = 'N':  do not diagonally scale or permute;
         = 'P':  permute only;
         = 'S':  scale only;
         = 'B':  both permute and scale.
         Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the
         matrices after permuting and/or balancing. Permuting does
         not change condition numbers (in exact arithmetic), but
         balancing does.
\param[in] JOBVL
         JOBVL is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the left generalized eigenvectors;
         = 'V':  compute the left generalized eigenvectors.
\param[in] JOBVR
         JOBVR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the right generalized eigenvectors;
         = 'V':  compute the right generalized eigenvectors.
\param[in] SENSE
         SENSE is CHARACTER*1
         Determines which reciprocal condition numbers are computed.
         = 'N': none are computed;
         = 'E': computed for eigenvalues only;
         = 'V': computed for eigenvectors only;
         = 'B': computed for eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A, B, VL, and VR.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the matrix A in the pair (A,B).
         On exit, A has been overwritten. If JOBVL='V' or JOBVR='V'
         or both, then A contains the first part of the real Schur
         form of the "balanced" versions of the input A and B.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB, N)
         On entry, the matrix B in the pair (A,B).
         On exit, B has been overwritten. If JOBVL='V' or JOBVR='V'
         or both, then B contains the second part of the real Schur
         form of the "balanced" versions of the input A and B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] ALPHAR
         ALPHAR is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] ALPHAI
         ALPHAI is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] BETA
         BETA is REAL array, dimension (N)
         On exit, (ALPHAR(j) + ALPHAI(j)*i)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will
         be the generalized eigenvalues.  If ALPHAI(j) is zero, then
         the j-th eigenvalue is real; if positive, then the j-th and
         (j+1)-st eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair, with
         ALPHAI(j+1) negative.
         Note: the quotients ALPHAR(j)/BETA(j) and ALPHAI(j)/BETA(j)
         may easily over- or underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.
         Thus, the user should avoid naively computing the ratio
         ALPHA/BETA. However, ALPHAR and ALPHAI will be always less
         than and usually comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and
         BETA always less than and usually comparable with norm(B).
\param[out] VL
         VL is REAL array, dimension (LDVL,N)
         If JOBVL = 'V', the left eigenvectors u(j) are stored one
         after another in the columns of VL, in the same order as
         their eigenvalues. If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then
         u(j) = VL(:,j), the j-th column of VL. If the j-th and
         (j+1)-th eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair, then
         u(j) = VL(:,j)+i*VL(:,j+1) and u(j+1) = VL(:,j)-i*VL(:,j+1).
         Each eigenvector will be scaled so the largest component have
         abs(real part) + abs(imag. part) = 1.
         Not referenced if JOBVL = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VL. LDVL >= 1, and
         if JOBVL = 'V', LDVL >= N.
\param[out] VR
         VR is REAL array, dimension (LDVR,N)
         If JOBVR = 'V', the right eigenvectors v(j) are stored one
         after another in the columns of VR, in the same order as
         their eigenvalues. If the j-th eigenvalue is real, then
         v(j) = VR(:,j), the j-th column of VR. If the j-th and
         (j+1)-th eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair, then
         v(j) = VR(:,j)+i*VR(:,j+1) and v(j+1) = VR(:,j)-i*VR(:,j+1).
         Each eigenvector will be scaled so the largest component have
         abs(real part) + abs(imag. part) = 1.
         Not referenced if JOBVR = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VR. LDVR >= 1, and
         if JOBVR = 'V', LDVR >= N.
\param[out] ILO
         ILO is INTEGER
\param[out] IHI
         IHI is INTEGER
         ILO and IHI are integer values such that on exit
         A(i,j) = 0 and B(i,j) = 0 if i > j and
         j = 1,...,ILO-1 or i = IHI+1,...,N.
         If BALANC = 'N' or 'S', ILO = 1 and IHI = N.
\param[out] LSCALE
         LSCALE is REAL array, dimension (N)
         Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied
         to the left side of A and B.  If PL(j) is the index of the
         row interchanged with row j, and DL(j) is the scaling
         factor applied to row j, then
           LSCALE(j) = PL(j)  for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                     = DL(j)  for j = ILO,...,IHI
                     = PL(j)  for j = IHI+1,...,N.
         The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
         then 1 to ILO-1.
\param[out] RSCALE
         RSCALE is REAL array, dimension (N)
         Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied
         to the right side of A and B.  If PR(j) is the index of the
         column interchanged with column j, and DR(j) is the scaling
         factor applied to column j, then
           RSCALE(j) = PR(j)  for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                     = DR(j)  for j = ILO,...,IHI
                     = PR(j)  for j = IHI+1,...,N
         The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
         then 1 to ILO-1.
\param[out] ABNRM
         ABNRM is REAL
         The one-norm of the balanced matrix A.
\param[out] BBNRM
         BBNRM is REAL
         The one-norm of the balanced matrix B.
\param[out] RCONDE
         RCONDE is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If SENSE = 'E' or 'B', the reciprocal condition numbers of
         the eigenvalues, stored in consecutive elements of the array.
         For a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues two consecutive
         elements of RCONDE are set to the same value. Thus RCONDE(j),
         RCONDV(j), and the j-th columns of VL and VR all correspond
         to the j-th eigenpair.
         If SENSE = 'N' or 'V', RCONDE is not referenced.
\param[out] RCONDV
         RCONDV is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', the estimated reciprocal condition
         numbers of the eigenvectors, stored in consecutive elements
         of the array. For a complex eigenvector two consecutive
         elements of RCONDV are set to the same value. If the
         eigenvalues cannot be reordered to compute RCONDV(j),
         RCONDV(j) is set to 0; this can only occur when the true
         value would be very small anyway.
         If SENSE = 'N' or 'E', RCONDV is not referenced.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,2*N).
         If BALANC = 'S' or 'B', or JOBVL = 'V', or JOBVR = 'V',
         LWORK >= max(1,6*N).
         If SENSE = 'E', LWORK >= max(1,10*N).
         If SENSE = 'V' or 'B', LWORK >= 2*N*N+8*N+16.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N+6)
         If SENSE = 'E', IWORK is not referenced.
\param[out] BWORK
         BWORK is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         If SENSE = 'N', BWORK is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         = 1,...,N:
               The QZ iteration failed.  No eigenvectors have been
               calculated, but ALPHAR(j), ALPHAI(j), and BETA(j)
               should be correct for j=INFO+1,...,N.
         > N:  =N+1: other than QZ iteration failed in SHGEQZ.
               =N+2: error return from STGEVC.

\par Further Details:
 Balancing a matrix pair (A,B) includes, first, permuting rows and
 columns to isolate eigenvalues, second, applying diagonal similarity
 transformation to the rows and columns to make the rows and columns
 as close in norm as possible. The computed reciprocal condition
 numbers correspond to the balanced matrix. Permuting rows and columns
 will not change the condition numbers (in exact arithmetic) but
 diagonal scaling will.  For further explanation of balancing, see
 section 4.11.1.2 of LAPACK Users' Guide.
 An approximate error bound on the chordal distance between the i-th
 computed generalized eigenvalue w and the corresponding exact
 eigenvalue lambda is
      chord(w, lambda) <= EPS * norm(ABNRM, BBNRM) / RCONDE(I)
 An approximate error bound for the angle between the i-th computed
 eigenvector VL(i) or VR(i) is given by
      EPS * norm(ABNRM, BBNRM) / DIF(i).
 For further explanation of the reciprocal condition numbers RCONDE
 and RCONDV, see section 4.11 of LAPACK User's Guide.
