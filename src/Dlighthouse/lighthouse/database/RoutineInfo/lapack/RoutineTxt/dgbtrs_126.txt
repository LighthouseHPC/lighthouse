DGBTRS solves a system of linear equations
   A * X = B  or  A**T * X = B
with a general band matrix A using the LU factorization computed
by DGBTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form of the system of equations.
         = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
         = 'T':  A**T* X = B  (Transpose)
         = 'C':  A**T* X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KL
         KL is INTEGER
         The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
\param[in] KU
         KU is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
         computed by DGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
         matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
         the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
         rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= 2*KL+KU+1.
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the matrix was
         interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, the solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
