ZHPGST reduces a complex Hermitian-definite generalized
eigenproblem to standard form, using packed storage.
If ITYPE = 1, the problem is A*x = lambda*B*x,
and A is overwritten by inv(U**H)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**H)
If ITYPE = 2 or 3, the problem is A*B*x = lambda*x or
B*A*x = lambda*x, and A is overwritten by U*A*U**H or L**H*A*L.
B must have been previously factorized as U**H*U or L*L**H by ZPPTRF.
Arguments:
\param[in] ITYPE
         ITYPE is INTEGER
         = 1: compute inv(U**H)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**H);
         = 2 or 3: compute U*A*U**H or L**H*A*L.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
                 U**H*U;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
                 L*L**H.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the transformed matrix, stored in the
         same format as A.
\param[in] BP
         BP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         The triangular factor from the Cholesky factorization of B,
         stored in the same format as A, as returned by ZPPTRF.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
