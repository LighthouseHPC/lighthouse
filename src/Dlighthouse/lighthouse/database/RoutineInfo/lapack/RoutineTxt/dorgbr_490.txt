DORGBR generates one of the real orthogonal matrices Q or P**T
determined by DGEBRD when reducing a real matrix A to bidiagonal
form: A = Q * B * P**T.  Q and P**T are defined as products of
elementary reflectors H(i) or G(i) respectively.
If VECT = 'Q', A is assumed to have been an M-by-K matrix, and Q
is of order M:
if m >= k, Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k) and DORGBR returns the first n
columns of Q, where m >= n >= k;
if m < k, Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(m-1) and DORGBR returns Q as an
M-by-M matrix.
If VECT = 'P', A is assumed to have been a K-by-N matrix, and P**T
is of order N:
if k < n, P**T = G(k) . . . G(2) G(1) and DORGBR returns the first m
rows of P**T, where n >= m >= k;
if k >= n, P**T = G(n-1) . . . G(2) G(1) and DORGBR returns P**T as
an N-by-N matrix.
Arguments:
\param[in] VECT
         VECT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the matrix Q or the matrix P**T is
         required, as defined in the transformation applied by DGEBRD:
         = 'Q':  generate Q;
         = 'P':  generate P**T.
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the matrix Q or P**T to be returned.
         M >= 0.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix Q or P**T to be returned.
         N >= 0.
         If VECT = 'Q', M >= N >= min(M,K);
         if VECT = 'P', N >= M >= min(N,K).
\param[in] K
         K is INTEGER
         If VECT = 'Q', the number of columns in the original M-by-K
         matrix reduced by DGEBRD.
         If VECT = 'P', the number of rows in the original K-by-N
         matrix reduced by DGEBRD.
         K >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the vectors which define the elementary reflectors,
         as returned by DGEBRD.
         On exit, the M-by-N matrix Q or P**T.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).
\param[in] TAU
         TAU is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
                               (min(M,K)) if VECT = 'Q'
                               (min(N,K)) if VECT = 'P'
         TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
         reflector H(i) or G(i), which determines Q or P**T, as
         returned by DGEBRD in its array argument TAUQ or TAUP.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,min(M,N)).
         For optimum performance LWORK >= min(M,N)*NB, where NB
         is the optimal blocksize.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
