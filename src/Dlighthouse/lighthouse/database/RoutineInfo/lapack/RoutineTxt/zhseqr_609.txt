   ZHSEQR computes the eigenvalues of a Hessenberg matrix H
   and, optionally, the matrices T and Z from the Schur decomposition
   H = Z T Z**H, where T is an upper triangular matrix (the
   Schur form), and Z is the unitary matrix of Schur vectors.
   Optionally Z may be postmultiplied into an input unitary
   matrix Q so that this routine can give the Schur factorization
   of a matrix A which has been reduced to the Hessenberg form H
   by the unitary matrix Q:  A = Q*H*Q**H = (QZ)*T*(QZ)**H.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOB
         JOB is CHARACTER*1
          = 'E':  compute eigenvalues only;
          = 'S':  compute eigenvalues and the Schur form T.
\param[in] COMPZ
         COMPZ is CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  no Schur vectors are computed;
          = 'I':  Z is initialized to the unit matrix and the matrix Z
                  of Schur vectors of H is returned;
          = 'V':  Z must contain an unitary matrix Q on entry, and
                  the product Q*Z is returned.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix H.  N .GE. 0.
\param[in] ILO
         ILO is INTEGER
\param[in] IHI
         IHI is INTEGER
          It is assumed that H is already upper triangular in rows
          and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N. ILO and IHI are normally
          set by a previous call to ZGEBAL, and then passed to ZGEHRD
          when the matrix output by ZGEBAL is reduced to Hessenberg
          form. Otherwise ILO and IHI should be set to 1 and N
          respectively.  If N.GT.0, then 1.LE.ILO.LE.IHI.LE.N.
          If N = 0, then ILO = 1 and IHI = 0.
\param[in,out] H
         H is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDH,N)
          On entry, the upper Hessenberg matrix H.
          On exit, if INFO = 0 and JOB = 'S', H contains the upper
          triangular matrix T from the Schur decomposition (the
          Schur form). If INFO = 0 and JOB = 'E', the contents of
          H are unspecified on exit.  (The output value of H when
          INFO.GT.0 is given under the description of INFO below.)
          Unlike earlier versions of ZHSEQR, this subroutine may
          explicitly H(i,j) = 0 for i.GT.j and j = 1, 2, ... ILO-1
          or j = IHI+1, IHI+2, ... N.
\param[in] LDH
         LDH is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array H. LDH .GE. max(1,N).
\param[out] W
         W is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
          The computed eigenvalues. If JOB = 'S', the eigenvalues are
          stored in the same order as on the diagonal of the Schur
          form returned in H, with W(i) = H(i,i).
\param[in,out] Z
         Z is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ,N)
          If COMPZ = 'N', Z is not referenced.
          If COMPZ = 'I', on entry Z need not be set and on exit,
          if INFO = 0, Z contains the unitary matrix Z of the Schur
          vectors of H.  If COMPZ = 'V', on entry Z must contain an
          N-by-N matrix Q, which is assumed to be equal to the unit
          matrix except for the submatrix Z(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI). On exit,
          if INFO = 0, Z contains Q*Z.
          Normally Q is the unitary matrix generated by ZUNGHR
          after the call to ZGEHRD which formed the Hessenberg matrix
          H. (The output value of Z when INFO.GT.0 is given under
          the description of INFO below.)
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array Z.  if COMPZ = 'I' or
          COMPZ = 'V', then LDZ.GE.MAX(1,N).  Otherwize, LDZ.GE.1.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LWORK)
          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns an estimate of
          the optimal value for LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK .GE. max(1,N)
          is sufficient and delivers very good and sometimes
          optimal performance.  However, LWORK as large as 11*N
          may be required for optimal performance.  A workspace
          query is recommended to determine the optimal workspace
          size.
          If LWORK = -1, then ZHSEQR does a workspace query.
          In this case, ZHSEQR checks the input parameters and
          estimates the optimal workspace size for the given
          values of N, ILO and IHI.  The estimate is returned
          in WORK(1).  No error message related to LWORK is
          issued by XERBLA.  Neither H nor Z are accessed.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
            =  0:  successful exit
          .LT. 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
                   value
          .GT. 0:  if INFO = i, ZHSEQR failed to compute all of
               the eigenvalues.  Elements 1:ilo-1 and i+1:n of WR
               and WI contain those eigenvalues which have been
               successfully computed.  (Failures are rare.)
               If INFO .GT. 0 and JOB = 'E', then on exit, the
               remaining unconverged eigenvalues are the eigen-
               values of the upper Hessenberg matrix rows and
               columns ILO through INFO of the final, output
               value of H.
               If INFO .GT. 0 and JOB   = 'S', then on exit
          (*)  (initial value of H)*U  = U*(final value of H)
               where U is a unitary matrix.  The final
               value of  H is upper Hessenberg and triangular in
               rows and columns INFO+1 through IHI.
               If INFO .GT. 0 and COMPZ = 'V', then on exit
                 (final value of Z)  =  (initial value of Z)*U
               where U is the unitary matrix in (*) (regard-
               less of the value of JOB.)
               If INFO .GT. 0 and COMPZ = 'I', then on exit
                     (final value of Z)  = U
               where U is the unitary matrix in (*) (regard-
               less of the value of JOB.)
               If INFO .GT. 0 and COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not
               accessed.

\par Further Details:
            Default values supplied by
            ILAENV(ISPEC,'ZHSEQR',JOB(:1)//COMPZ(:1),N,ILO,IHI,LWORK).
            It is suggested that these defaults be adjusted in order
            to attain best performance in each particular
            computational environment.
           ISPEC=12: The ZLAHQR vs ZLAQR0 crossover point.
                     Default: 75. (Must be at least 11.)
           ISPEC=13: Recommended deflation window size.
                     This depends on ILO, IHI and NS.  NS is the
                     number of simultaneous shifts returned
                     by ILAENV(ISPEC=15).  (See ISPEC=15 below.)
                     The default for (IHI-ILO+1).LE.500 is NS.
                     The default for (IHI-ILO+1).GT.500 is 3*NS/2.
           ISPEC=14: Nibble crossover point. (See IPARMQ for
                     details.)  Default: 14% of deflation window
                     size.
           ISPEC=15: Number of simultaneous shifts in a multishift
                     QR iteration.
                     If IHI-ILO+1 is ...
                     greater than      ...but less    ... the
                     or equal to ...      than        default is
                          1               30          NS =   2(+)
                         30               60          NS =   4(+)
                         60              150          NS =  10(+)
                        150              590          NS =  **
                        590             3000          NS =  64
                       3000             6000          NS = 128
                       6000             infinity      NS = 256
                 (+)  By default some or all matrices of this order
                      are passed to the implicit double shift routine
                      ZLAHQR and this parameter is ignored.  See
                      ISPEC=12 above and comments in IPARMQ for
                      details.
                (**)  The asterisks (**) indicate an ad-hoc
                      function of N increasing from 10 to 64.
           ISPEC=16: Select structured matrix multiply.
                     If the number of simultaneous shifts (specified
                     by ISPEC=15) is less than 14, then the default
                     for ISPEC=16 is 0.  Otherwise the default for
                     ISPEC=16 is 2.
