SSPGV computes all the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.
Here A and B are assumed to be symmetric, stored in packed format,
and B is also positive definite.
Arguments:
\param[in] ITYPE
         ITYPE is INTEGER
         Specifies the problem type to be solved:
         = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x
         = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x
         = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangles of A and B are stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangles of A and B are stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is REAL array, dimension
                           (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the contents of AP are destroyed.
\param[in,out] BP
         BP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
         B, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of B
         is stored in the array BP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', BP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = B(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', BP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = B(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization B = U**T*U or B = L*L**T, in the same storage
         format as B.
\param[out] W
         W is REAL array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] Z
         Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, Z contains the matrix Z of
         eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
         if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**T*B*Z = I;
         if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (3*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  SPPTRF or SSPEV returned an error code:
            <= N:  if INFO = i, SSPEV failed to converge;
                   i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
                   tridiagonal form did not converge to zero.
            > N:   if INFO = n + i, for 1 <= i <= n, then the leading
                   minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
                   The factorization of B could not be completed and
                   no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
