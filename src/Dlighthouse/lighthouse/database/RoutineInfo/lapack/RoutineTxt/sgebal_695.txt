SGEBAL balances a general real matrix A.  This involves, first,
permuting A by a similarity transformation to isolate eigenvalues
in the first 1 to ILO-1 and last IHI+1 to N elements on the
diagonal; and second, applying a diagonal similarity transformation
to rows and columns ILO to IHI to make the rows and columns as
close in norm as possible.  Both steps are optional.
Balancing may reduce the 1-norm of the matrix, and improve the
accuracy of the computed eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOB
         JOB is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the operations to be performed on A:
         = 'N':  none:  simply set ILO = 1, IHI = N, SCALE(I) = 1.0
                 for i = 1,...,N;
         = 'P':  permute only;
         = 'S':  scale only;
         = 'B':  both permute and scale.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the input matrix A.
         On exit,  A is overwritten by the balanced matrix.
         If JOB = 'N', A is not referenced.
         See Further Details.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] ILO
         ILO is INTEGER
\param[out] IHI
         IHI is INTEGER
         ILO and IHI are set to integers such that on exit
         A(i,j) = 0 if i > j and j = 1,...,ILO-1 or I = IHI+1,...,N.
         If JOB = 'N' or 'S', ILO = 1 and IHI = N.
\param[out] SCALE
         SCALE is REAL array, dimension (N)
         Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied to
         A.  If P(j) is the index of the row and column interchanged
         with row and column j and D(j) is the scaling factor
         applied to row and column j, then
         SCALE(j) = P(j)    for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                  = D(j)    for j = ILO,...,IHI
                  = P(j)    for j = IHI+1,...,N.
         The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
         then 1 to ILO-1.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit.
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.

\par Further Details:
 The permutations consist of row and column interchanges which put
 the matrix in the form
            ( T1   X   Y  )
    P A P = (  0   B   Z  )
            (  0   0   T2 )
 where T1 and T2 are upper triangular matrices whose eigenvalues lie
 along the diagonal.  The column indices ILO and IHI mark the starting
 and ending columns of the submatrix B. Balancing consists of applying
 a diagonal similarity transformation inv(D) * B * D to make the
 1-norms of each row of B and its corresponding column nearly equal.
 The output matrix is
    ( T1     X*D          Y    )
    (  0  inv(D)*B*D  inv(D)*Z ).
    (  0      0           T2   )
 Information about the permutations P and the diagonal matrix D is
 returned in the vector SCALE.
 This subroutine is based on the EISPACK routine BALANC.
