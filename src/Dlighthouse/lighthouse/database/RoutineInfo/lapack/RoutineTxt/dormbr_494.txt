If VECT = 'Q', DORMBR overwrites the general real M-by-N matrix C
with
                SIDE = 'L'     SIDE = 'R'
TRANS = 'N':      Q * C          C * Q
TRANS = 'T':      Q**T * C       C * Q**T
If VECT = 'P', DORMBR overwrites the general real M-by-N matrix C
with
                SIDE = 'L'     SIDE = 'R'
TRANS = 'N':      P * C          C * P
TRANS = 'T':      P**T * C       C * P**T
Here Q and P**T are the orthogonal matrices determined by DGEBRD when
reducing a real matrix A to bidiagonal form: A = Q * B * P**T. Q and
P**T are defined as products of elementary reflectors H(i) and G(i)
respectively.
Let nq = m if SIDE = 'L' and nq = n if SIDE = 'R'. Thus nq is the
order of the orthogonal matrix Q or P**T that is applied.
If VECT = 'Q', A is assumed to have been an NQ-by-K matrix:
if nq >= k, Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k);
if nq < k, Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(nq-1).
If VECT = 'P', A is assumed to have been a K-by-NQ matrix:
if k < nq, P = G(1) G(2) . . . G(k);
if k >= nq, P = G(1) G(2) . . . G(nq-1).

         The number of columns of the matrix C. N >= 0.
\param[in] K
         K is INTEGER
         If VECT = 'Q', the number of columns in the original
         matrix reduced by DGEBRD.

         matrix reduced by DGEBRD.
         K >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
                               (LDA,min(nq,K)) if VECT = 'Q'
                               (LDA,nq)        if VECT = 'P'
         The vectors which define the elementary reflectors H(i) and
         G(i), whose products determine the matrices Q and P, as
         returned by DGEBRD.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.
         If VECT = 'Q', LDA >= max(1,nq);
         if VECT = 'P', LDA >= max(1,min(nq,K)).
\param[in] TAU
         TAU is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(nq,K))
         TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
         reflector H(i) or G(i) which determines Q or P, as returned
         by DGEBRD in the array argument TAUQ or TAUP.
\param[in,out] C
         C is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDC,N)
         On entry, the M-by-N matrix C.
         On exit, C is overwritten by Q*C or Q**T*C or C*Q**T or C*Q
         or P*C or P**T*C or C*P or C*P**T.
\param[in] LDC
         LDC is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >= max(1,M).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.
         If SIDE = 'L', LWORK >= max(1,N);
         if SIDE = 'R', LWORK >= max(1,M).
         For optimum performance LWORK >= N*NB if SIDE = 'L', and
         LWORK >= M*NB if SIDE = 'R', where NB is the optimal
         blocksize.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
