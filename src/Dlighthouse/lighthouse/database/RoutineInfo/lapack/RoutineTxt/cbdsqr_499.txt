CBDSQR computes the singular values and, optionally, the right and/or
left singular vectors from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of
a real N-by-N (upper or lower) bidiagonal matrix B using the implicit
zero-shift QR algorithm.  The SVD of B has the form

   B = Q * S * P**H

where S is the diagonal matrix of singular values, Q is an orthogonal
matrix of left singular vectors, and P is an orthogonal matrix of
right singular vectors.  If left singular vectors are requested, this
subroutine actually returns U*Q instead of Q, and, if right singular
vectors are requested, this subroutine returns P**H*VT instead of
P**H, for given complex input matrices U and VT.  When U and VT are
the unitary matrices that reduce a general matrix A to bidiagonal
form: A = U*B*VT, as computed by CGEBRD, then

   A = (U*Q) * S * (P**H*VT)

is the SVD of A.  Optionally, the subroutine may also compute Q**H*C
for a given complex input matrix C.

         D is REAL array, dimension (N)
         On entry, the n diagonal elements of the bidiagonal matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO=0, the singular values of B in decreasing
         order.
\param[in,out] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, the N-1 offdiagonal elements of the bidiagonal
         matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, E is destroyed; if INFO > 0, D and E
         will contain the diagonal and superdiagonal elements of a
         bidiagonal matrix orthogonally equivalent to the one given
         as input.
\param[in,out] VT
         VT is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVT, NCVT)
         On entry, an N-by-NCVT matrix VT.
         On exit, VT is overwritten by P**H * VT.
         Not referenced if NCVT = 0.
\param[in] LDVT
         LDVT is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VT.
         LDVT >= max(1,N) if NCVT > 0; LDVT >= 1 if NCVT = 0.
\param[in,out] U
         U is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDU, N)
         On entry, an NRU-by-N matrix U.
         On exit, U is overwritten by U * Q.
         Not referenced if NRU = 0.

\param[in,out] C
         C is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDC, NCC)
         On entry, an N-by-NCC matrix C.
         On exit, C is overwritten by Q**H * C.

\param[in] LDC
         LDC is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array C.
         LDC >= max(1,N) if NCC > 0; LDC >=1 if NCC = 0.
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (2*N)
         if NCVT = NRU = NCC = 0, (max(1, 4*N-4)) otherwise
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  the algorithm did not converge; D and E contain the
               elements of a bidiagonal matrix which is orthogonally
               similar to the input matrix B;  if INFO = i, i
               elements of E have not converged to zero.
\par Internal Parameters:
 TOLMUL  REAL, default = max(10,min(100,EPS**(-1/8)))
         TOLMUL controls the convergence criterion of the QR loop.
         If it is positive, TOLMUL*EPS is the desired relative
            precision in the computed singular values.
         If it is negative, abs(TOLMUL*EPS*sigma_max) is the
            desired absolute accuracy in the computed singular
            values (corresponds to relative accuracy
            abs(TOLMUL*EPS) in the largest singular value.
         abs(TOLMUL) should be between 1 and 1/EPS, and preferably
            between 10 (for fast convergence) and .1/EPS
            (for there to be some accuracy in the results).
         Default is to lose at either one eighth or 2 of the
            available decimal digits in each computed singular value
            (whichever is smaller).
 MAXITR  INTEGER, default = 6
         MAXITR controls the maximum number of passes of the
         algorithm through its inner loop. The algorithms stops
         (and so fails to converge) if the number of passes
         through the inner loop exceeds MAXITR*N**2.
