DGESV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
   A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is
used to factor A as
   A = P * L * U,
where P is a permutation matrix, L is unit lower triangular, and U is
upper triangular.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the
system of equations A * X = B.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
         matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the N-by-N coefficient matrix A.
         On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
         A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The pivot indices that define the permutation matrix P;
         row i of the matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the N-by-NRHS matrix of right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
               has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
               singular, so the solution could not be computed.
