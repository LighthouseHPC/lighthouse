CGEES computes for an N-by-N complex nonsymmetric matrix A, the
eigenvalues, the Schur form T, and, optionally, the matrix of Schur
vectors Z.  This gives the Schur factorization A = Z*T*(Z**H).
Optionally, it also orders the eigenvalues on the diagonal of the
Schur form so that selected eigenvalues are at the top left.
The leading columns of Z then form an orthonormal basis for the
invariant subspace corresponding to the selected eigenvalues.
A complex matrix is in Schur form if it is upper triangular.
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBVS
         JOBVS is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': Schur vectors are not computed;
         = 'V': Schur vectors are computed.
\param[in] SORT
         SORT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not to order the eigenvalues on the
         diagonal of the Schur form.
         = 'N': Eigenvalues are not ordered:
         = 'S': Eigenvalues are ordered (see SELECT).
\param[in] SELECT
         SELECT is a LOGICAL FUNCTION of one COMPLEX argument
         SELECT must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling subroutine.
         If SORT = 'S', SELECT is used to select eigenvalues to order
         to the top left of the Schur form.
         IF SORT = 'N', SELECT is not referenced.
         The eigenvalue W(j) is selected if SELECT(W(j)) is true.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
         On exit, A has been overwritten by its Schur form T.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] SDIM
         SDIM is INTEGER
         If SORT = 'N', SDIM = 0.
         If SORT = 'S', SDIM = number of eigenvalues for which
                        SELECT is true.
\param[out] W
         W is COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
         W contains the computed eigenvalues, in the same order that
         they appear on the diagonal of the output Schur form T.
\param[out] VS
         VS is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVS,N)
         If JOBVS = 'V', VS contains the unitary matrix Z of Schur
         vectors.
         If JOBVS = 'N', VS is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVS
         LDVS is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VS.  LDVS >= 1; if
         JOBVS = 'V', LDVS >= N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,2*N).
         For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] BWORK
         BWORK is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         Not referenced if SORT = 'N'.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
              <= N:  the QR algorithm failed to compute all the
                     eigenvalues; elements 1:ILO-1 and i+1:N of W
                     contain those eigenvalues which have converged;
                     if JOBVS = 'V', VS contains the matrix which
                     reduces A to its partially converged Schur form.
              = N+1: the eigenvalues could not be reordered because
                     some eigenvalues were too close to separate (the
                     problem is very ill-conditioned);
              = N+2: after reordering, roundoff changed values of
                     some complex eigenvalues so that leading
                     eigenvalues in the Schur form no longer satisfy
                     SELECT = .TRUE..  This could also be caused by
                     underflow due to scaling.
