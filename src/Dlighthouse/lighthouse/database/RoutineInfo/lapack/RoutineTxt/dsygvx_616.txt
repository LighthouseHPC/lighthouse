DSYGVX computes selected eigenvalues, and optionally, eigenvectors
of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A
and B are assumed to be symmetric and B is also positive definite.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be selected by specifying either a
range of values or a range of indices for the desired eigenvalues.
Arguments:
\param[in] ITYPE
         ITYPE is INTEGER
         Specifies the problem type to be solved:
         = 1:  A*x = (lambda)*B*x
         = 2:  A*B*x = (lambda)*x
         = 3:  B*A*x = (lambda)*x
\param[in] JOBZ
         JOBZ is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
         = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\param[in] RANGE
         RANGE is CHARACTER*1
         = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found.
         = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
                will be found.
         = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A and B are stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A and B are stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix pencil (A,B).  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
         leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
         upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
         the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
         the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
         On exit, the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') or the upper
         triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the diagonal, is
         destroyed.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB, N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix B.  If UPLO = 'U', the
         leading N-by-N upper triangular part of B contains the
         upper triangular part of the matrix B.  If UPLO = 'L',
         the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of B contains
         the lower triangular part of the matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO <= N, the part of B containing the matrix is
         overwritten by the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization B = U**T*U or B = L*L**T.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in] VL
         VL is DOUBLE PRECISION
\param[in] VU
         VU is DOUBLE PRECISION
         If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
         be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
\param[in] IL
         IL is INTEGER
\param[in] IU
         IU is INTEGER
         If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
         smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
         1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
         Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
\param[in] ABSTOL
         ABSTOL is DOUBLE PRECISION
         The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
         An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
         when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
         of width less than or equal to
                 ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
         where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
         or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
         where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
         by reducing C to tridiagonal form, where C is the symmetric
         matrix of the standard symmetric problem to which the
         generalized problem is transformed.
         Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
         set to twice the underflow threshold 2*DLAMCH('S'), not zero.
         If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
         eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
         2*DLAMCH('S').
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
         If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
\param[out] W
         W is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         On normal exit, the first M elements contain the selected
         eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[out] Z
         Z is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
         If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
         contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
         corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
         column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
         The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
         if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**T*B*Z = I;
         if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.
         If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
         contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
         index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
         Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
         supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
         is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
\param[in] LDZ
         LDZ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
         JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,8*N).
         For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+3)*N,
         where NB is the blocksize for DSYTRD returned by ILAENV.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] IWORK
         IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (5*N)
\param[out] IFAIL
         IFAIL is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
         IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
         indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
         If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  DPOTRF or DSYEVX returned an error code:
            <= N:  if INFO = i, DSYEVX failed to converge;
                   i eigenvectors failed to converge.  Their indices
                   are stored in array IFAIL.
            > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= N, then the leading
                   minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
                   The factorization of B could not be completed and
                   no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
