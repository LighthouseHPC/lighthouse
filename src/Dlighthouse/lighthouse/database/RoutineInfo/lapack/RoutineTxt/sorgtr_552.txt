SORGTR generates a real orthogonal matrix Q which is defined as the
product of n-1 elementary reflectors of order N, as returned by
SSYTRD:
if UPLO = 'U', Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1),
if UPLO = 'L', Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U': Upper triangle of A contains elementary reflectors
                from SSYTRD;
         = 'L': Lower triangle of A contains elementary reflectors
                from SSYTRD.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix Q. N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the vectors which define the elementary reflectors,
         as returned by SSYTRD.
         On exit, the N-by-N orthogonal matrix Q.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] TAU
         TAU is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
         reflector H(i), as returned by SSYTRD.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,N-1).
         For optimum performance LWORK >= (N-1)*NB, where NB is
         the optimal blocksize.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
