CGGEV computes for a pair of N-by-N complex nonsymmetric matrices
(A,B), the generalized eigenvalues, and optionally, the left and/or
right generalized eigenvectors.
A generalized eigenvalue for a pair of matrices (A,B) is a scalar
lambda or a ratio alpha/beta = lambda, such that A - lambda*B is
singular. It is usually represented as the pair (alpha,beta), as
there is a reasonable interpretation for beta=0, and even for both
being zero.
The right generalized eigenvector v(j) corresponding to the
generalized eigenvalue lambda(j) of (A,B) satisfies
             A * v(j) = lambda(j) * B * v(j).
The left generalized eigenvector u(j) corresponding to the
generalized eigenvalues lambda(j) of (A,B) satisfies
             u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H * B
where u(j)**H is the conjugate-transpose of u(j).
Arguments:
\param[in] JOBVL
         JOBVL is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the left generalized eigenvectors;
         = 'V':  compute the left generalized eigenvectors.
\param[in] JOBVR
         JOBVR is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not compute the right generalized eigenvectors;
         = 'V':  compute the right generalized eigenvectors.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A, B, VL, and VR.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA, N)
         On entry, the matrix A in the pair (A,B).
         On exit, A has been overwritten.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB, N)
         On entry, the matrix B in the pair (A,B).
         On exit, B has been overwritten.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] ALPHA
         ALPHA is COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
\param[out] BETA
         BETA is COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
         On exit, ALPHA(j)/BETA(j), j=1,...,N, will be the
         generalized eigenvalues.
         Note: the quotients ALPHA(j)/BETA(j) may easily over- or
         underflow, and BETA(j) may even be zero.  Thus, the user
         should avoid naively computing the ratio alpha/beta.
         However, ALPHA will be always less than and usually
         comparable with norm(A) in magnitude, and BETA always less
         than and usually comparable with norm(B).
\param[out] VL
         VL is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVL,N)
         If JOBVL = 'V', the left generalized eigenvectors u(j) are
         stored one after another in the columns of VL, in the same
         order as their eigenvalues.
         Each eigenvector is scaled so the largest component has
         abs(real part) + abs(imag. part) = 1.
         Not referenced if JOBVL = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VL. LDVL >= 1, and
         if JOBVL = 'V', LDVL >= N.
\param[out] VR
         VR is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVR,N)
         If JOBVR = 'V', the right generalized eigenvectors v(j) are
         stored one after another in the columns of VR, in the same
         order as their eigenvalues.
         Each eigenvector is scaled so the largest component has
         abs(real part) + abs(imag. part) = 1.
         Not referenced if JOBVR = 'N'.
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the matrix VR. LDVR >= 1, and
         if JOBVR = 'V', LDVR >= N.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,2*N).
         For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (8*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         =1,...,N:
               The QZ iteration failed.  No eigenvectors have been
               calculated, but ALPHA(j) and BETA(j) should be
               correct for j=INFO+1,...,N.
         > N:  =N+1: other then QZ iteration failed in SHGEQZ,
               =N+2: error return from STGEVC.
