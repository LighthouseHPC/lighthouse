ZGBBRD reduces a complex general m-by-n band matrix A to real upper
bidiagonal form B by a unitary transformation: Q**H * A * P = B.
The routine computes B, and optionally forms Q or P**H, or computes
Q**H*C for a given matrix C.
Arguments:
\param[in] VECT
         VECT is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether or not the matrices Q and P**H are to be
         formed.
         = 'N': do not form Q or P**H;
         = 'Q': form Q only;
         = 'P': form P**H only;
         = 'B': form both.
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NCC
         NCC is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix C.  NCC >= 0.
\param[in] KL
         KL is INTEGER
         The number of subdiagonals of the matrix A. KL >= 0.
\param[in] KU
         KU is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A. KU >= 0.
\param[in,out] AB
         AB is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         On entry, the m-by-n band matrix A, stored in rows 1 to
         KL+KU+1. The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of
         the array AB as follows:
         AB(ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl).
         On exit, A is overwritten by values generated during the
         reduction.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A. LDAB >= KL+KU+1.
\param[out] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N))
         The diagonal elements of the bidiagonal matrix B.
\param[out] E
         E is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N)-1)
         The superdiagonal elements of the bidiagonal matrix B.
\param[out] Q
         Q is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDQ,M)
         If VECT = 'Q' or 'B', the m-by-m unitary matrix Q.
         If VECT = 'N' or 'P', the array Q is not referenced.
\param[in] LDQ
         LDQ is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array Q.
         LDQ >= max(1,M) if VECT = 'Q' or 'B'; LDQ >= 1 otherwise.
\param[out] PT
         PT is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDPT,N)
         If VECT = 'P' or 'B', the n-by-n unitary matrix P'.
         If VECT = 'N' or 'Q', the array PT is not referenced.
\param[in] LDPT
         LDPT is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array PT.
         LDPT >= max(1,N) if VECT = 'P' or 'B'; LDPT >= 1 otherwise.
\param[in,out] C
         C is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDC,NCC)
         On entry, an m-by-ncc matrix C.
         On exit, C is overwritten by Q**H*C.
         C is not referenced if NCC = 0.
\param[in] LDC
         LDC is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array C.
         LDC >= max(1,M) if NCC > 0; LDC >= 1 if NCC = 0.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (max(M,N))
\param[out] RWORK
         RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (max(M,N))
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit.
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
