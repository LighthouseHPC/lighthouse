ZSYTRS2 solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a real
symmetric matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**T or
A = L*D*L**T computed by ZSYTRF and converted by ZSYCONV.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
         as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
         = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
         obtain the factor U or L as computed by ZSYTRF.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
         as determined by ZSYTRF.
\param[in,out] B
         B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, the solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
