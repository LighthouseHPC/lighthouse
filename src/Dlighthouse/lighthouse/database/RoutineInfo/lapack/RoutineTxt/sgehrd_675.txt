SGEHRD reduces a real general matrix A to upper Hessenberg form H by
an orthogonal similarity transformation:  Q**T * A * Q = H .
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] ILO
         ILO is INTEGER
\param[in] IHI
         IHI is INTEGER
         It is assumed that A is already upper triangular in rows
         and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N. ILO and IHI are normally
         set by a previous call to SGEBAL; otherwise they should be
         set to 1 and N respectively. See Further Details.
         1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N, if N > 0; ILO=1 and IHI=0, if N=0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the N-by-N general matrix to be reduced.
         On exit, the upper triangle and the first subdiagonal of A
         are overwritten with the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and the
         elements below the first subdiagonal, with the array TAU,
         represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product of elementary
         reflectors. See Further Details.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[out] TAU
         TAU is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
         Details). Elements 1:ILO-1 and IHI:N-1 of TAU are set to
         zero.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (LWORK)
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N).
         For optimum performance LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the
         optimal blocksize.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.

\par Further Details:
 The matrix Q is represented as a product of (ihi-ilo) elementary
 reflectors
    Q = H(ilo) H(ilo+1) . . . H(ihi-1).
 Each H(i) has the form
    H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T
 where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
 v(1:i) = 0, v(i+1) = 1 and v(ihi+1:n) = 0; v(i+2:ihi) is stored on
 exit in A(i+2:ihi,i), and tau in TAU(i).
 The contents of A are illustrated by the following example, with
 n = 7, ilo = 2 and ihi = 6:
 on entry,                        on exit,
 ( a   a   a   a   a   a   a )    (  a   a   h   h   h   h   a )
 (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      a   h   h   h   h   a )
 (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      h   h   h   h   h   h )
 (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      v2  h   h   h   h   h )
 (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      v2  v3  h   h   h   h )
 (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      v2  v3  v4  h   h   h )
 (                         a )    (                          a )
 where a denotes an element of the original matrix A, h denotes a
 modified element of the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and vi denotes an
 element of the vector defining H(i).
