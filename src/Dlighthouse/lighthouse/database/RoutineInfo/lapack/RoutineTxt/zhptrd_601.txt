ZHPTRD reduces a complex Hermitian matrix A stored in packed form to
real symmetric tridiagonal form T by a unitary similarity
transformation: Q**H * A * Q = T.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
         of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
         tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
         superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the unitary
         matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
         = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
         written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
         matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
         the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q as a product
         of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.
\param[out] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
         D(i) = A(i,i).
\param[out] E
         E is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
         The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
         E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.
\param[out] TAU
         TAU is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
         Details).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

\par Further Details:
 If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
 reflectors
    Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).
 Each H(i) has the form
    H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H
 where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
 v(i+1:n) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in AP,
 overwriting A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau is stored in TAU(i).
 If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
 reflectors
    Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
 Each H(i) has the form
    H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H
 where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
 v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in AP,
 overwriting A(i+2:n,i), and tau is stored in TAU(i).
