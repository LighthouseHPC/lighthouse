STRTRS solves a triangular system of the form
   A * X = B  or  A**T * X = B,
where A is a triangular matrix of order N, and B is an N-by-NRHS
matrix.  A check is made to verify that A is nonsingular.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
         = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the form of the system of equations:
         = 'N':  A * X = B  (No transpose)
         = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
         = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
\param[in] DIAG
         DIAG is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
         = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         The triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
         upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper
         triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of
         A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
         triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular
         matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
         referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are
         also not referenced and are assumed to be 1.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element of A is zero,
              indicating that the matrix is singular and the solutions
              X have not been computed.
