SSTERF computes all eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix
using the Pal-Walker-Kahan variant of the QL or QR algorithm.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] D
         D is REAL array, dimension (N)
         On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
\param[in,out] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
         matrix.
         On exit, E has been destroyed.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  the algorithm failed to find all of the eigenvalues in
               a total of 30*N iterations; if INFO = i, then i
               elements of E have not converged to zero.
