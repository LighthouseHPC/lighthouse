SHSEIN uses inverse iteration to find specified right and/or left
eigenvectors of a real upper Hessenberg matrix H.
The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of the matrix H
corresponding to an eigenvalue w are defined by:
             H * x = w * x,     y**h * H = w * y**h
where y**h denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector y.
Arguments:
\param[in] SIDE
         SIDE is CHARACTER*1
         = 'R': compute right eigenvectors only;
         = 'L': compute left eigenvectors only;
         = 'B': compute both right and left eigenvectors.
\param[in] EIGSRC
         EIGSRC is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the source of eigenvalues supplied in (WR,WI):
         = 'Q': the eigenvalues were found using SHSEQR; thus, if
                H has zero subdiagonal elements, and so is
                block-triangular, then the j-th eigenvalue can be
                assumed to be an eigenvalue of the block containing
                the j-th row/column.  This property allows SHSEIN to
                perform inverse iteration on just one diagonal block.
         = 'N': no assumptions are made on the correspondence
                between eigenvalues and diagonal blocks.  In this
                case, SHSEIN must always perform inverse iteration
                using the whole matrix H.
\param[in] INITV
         INITV is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': no initial vectors are supplied;
         = 'U': user-supplied initial vectors are stored in the arrays
                VL and/or VR.
\param[in,out] SELECT
         SELECT is LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
         Specifies the eigenvectors to be computed. To select the
         real eigenvector corresponding to a real eigenvalue WR(j),
         SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE.. To select the complex
         eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue
         (WR(j),WI(j)), with complex conjugate (WR(j+1),WI(j+1)),
         either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) or both must be set to
         .TRUE.; then on exit SELECT(j) is .TRUE. and SELECT(j+1) is
         .FALSE..
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix H.  N >= 0.
\param[in] H
         H is REAL array, dimension (LDH,N)
         The upper Hessenberg matrix H.
         If a NaN is detected in H, the routine will return with INFO=-6.
\param[in] LDH
         LDH is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array H.  LDH >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] WR
         WR is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[in] WI
         WI is REAL array, dimension (N)
         On entry, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of
         H; a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues must be stored in
         consecutive elements of WR and WI.
         On exit, WR may have been altered since close eigenvalues
         are perturbed slightly in searching for independent
         eigenvectors.
\param[in,out] VL
         VL is REAL array, dimension (LDVL,MM)
         On entry, if INITV = 'U' and SIDE = 'L' or 'B', VL must
         contain starting vectors for the inverse iteration for the
         left eigenvectors; the starting vector for each eigenvector
         must be in the same column(s) in which the eigenvector will
         be stored.
         On exit, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B', the left eigenvectors
         specified by SELECT will be stored consecutively in the
         columns of VL, in the same order as their eigenvalues. A
         complex eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue is
         stored in two consecutive columns, the first holding the real
         part and the second the imaginary part.
         If SIDE = 'R', VL is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVL
         LDVL is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VL.
         LDVL >= max(1,N) if SIDE = 'L' or 'B'; LDVL >= 1 otherwise.
\param[in,out] VR
         VR is REAL array, dimension (LDVR,MM)
         On entry, if INITV = 'U' and SIDE = 'R' or 'B', VR must
         contain starting vectors for the inverse iteration for the
         right eigenvectors; the starting vector for each eigenvector
         must be in the same column(s) in which the eigenvector will
         be stored.
         On exit, if SIDE = 'R' or 'B', the right eigenvectors
         specified by SELECT will be stored consecutively in the
         columns of VR, in the same order as their eigenvalues. A
         complex eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue is
         stored in two consecutive columns, the first holding the real
         part and the second the imaginary part.
         If SIDE = 'L', VR is not referenced.
\param[in] LDVR
         LDVR is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array VR.
         LDVR >= max(1,N) if SIDE = 'R' or 'B'; LDVR >= 1 otherwise.
\param[in] MM
         MM is INTEGER
         The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR. MM >= M.
\param[out] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR required to
         store the eigenvectors; each selected real eigenvector
         occupies one column and each selected complex eigenvector
         occupies two columns.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension ((N+2)*N)
\param[out] IFAILL
         IFAILL is INTEGER array, dimension (MM)
         If SIDE = 'L' or 'B', IFAILL(i) = j > 0 if the left
         eigenvector in the i-th column of VL (corresponding to the
         eigenvalue w(j)) failed to converge; IFAILL(i) = 0 if the
         eigenvector converged satisfactorily. If the i-th and (i+1)th
         columns of VL hold a complex eigenvector, then IFAILL(i) and
         IFAILL(i+1) are set to the same value.
         If SIDE = 'R', IFAILL is not referenced.
\param[out] IFAILR
         IFAILR is INTEGER array, dimension (MM)
         If SIDE = 'R' or 'B', IFAILR(i) = j > 0 if the right
         eigenvector in the i-th column of VR (corresponding to the
         eigenvalue w(j)) failed to converge; IFAILR(i) = 0 if the
         eigenvector converged satisfactorily. If the i-th and (i+1)th
         columns of VR hold a complex eigenvector, then IFAILR(i) and
         IFAILR(i+1) are set to the same value.
         If SIDE = 'L', IFAILR is not referenced.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, i is the number of eigenvectors which
               failed to converge; see IFAILL and IFAILR for further
               details.
