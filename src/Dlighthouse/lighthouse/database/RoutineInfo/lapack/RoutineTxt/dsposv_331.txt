DSPOSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
   A * X = B,
where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B
are N-by-NRHS matrices.
DSPOSV first attempts to factorize the matrix in SINGLE PRECISION
and use this factorization within an iterative refinement procedure
to produce a solution with DOUBLE PRECISION normwise backward error
quality (see below). If the approach fails the method switches to a
DOUBLE PRECISION factorization and solve.
The iterative refinement is not going to be a winning strategy if
the ratio SINGLE PRECISION performance over DOUBLE PRECISION
performance is too small. A reasonable strategy should take the
number of right-hand sides and the size of the matrix into account.
This might be done with a call to ILAENV in the future. Up to now, we
always try iterative refinement.
The iterative refinement process is stopped if
    ITER > ITERMAX
or for all the RHS we have:
    RNRM < SQRT(N)*XNRM*ANRM*EPS*BWDMAX
where
    o ITER is the number of the current iteration in the iterative
      refinement process
    o RNRM is the infinity-norm of the residual
    o XNRM is the infinity-norm of the solution
    o ANRM is the infinity-operator-norm of the matrix A
    o EPS is the machine epsilon returned by DLAMCH('Epsilon')
The value ITERMAX and BWDMAX are fixed to 30 and 1.0D+00
respectively.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
         matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array,
         dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
         N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
         triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
         leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
         triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
         triangular part of A is not referenced.
         On exit, if iterative refinement has been successfully used
         (INFO.EQ.0 and ITER.GE.0, see description below), then A is
         unchanged, if double precision factorization has been used
         (INFO.EQ.0 and ITER.LT.0, see description below), then the
         array A contains the factor U or L from the Cholesky
         factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] X
         X is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
         If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N,NRHS)
         This array is used to hold the residual vectors.
\param[out] SWORK
         SWORK is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+NRHS))
         This array is used to use the single precision matrix and the
         right-hand sides or solutions in single precision.
\param[out] ITER
         ITER is INTEGER
         < 0: iterative refinement has failed, double precision
              factorization has been performed
              -1 : the routine fell back to full precision for
                   implementation- or machine-specific reasons
              -2 : narrowing the precision induced an overflow,
                   the routine fell back to full precision
              -3 : failure of SPOTRF
              -31: stop the iterative refinement after the 30th
                   iterations
         > 0: iterative refinement has been sucessfully used.
              Returns the number of iterations
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i of (DOUBLE
               PRECISION) A is not positive definite, so the
               factorization could not be completed, and the solution
               has not been computed.
