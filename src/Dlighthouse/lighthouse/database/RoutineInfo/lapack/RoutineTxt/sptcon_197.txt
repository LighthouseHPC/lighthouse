SPTCON computes the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a real symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix
using the factorization A = L*D*L**T or A = U**T*D*U computed by
SPTTRF.
Norm(inv(A)) is computed by a direct method, and the reciprocal of
the condition number is computed as
             RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] D
         D is REAL array, dimension (N)
         The n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D from the
         factorization of A, as computed by SPTTRF.
\param[in] E
         E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
         The (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the unit bidiagonal factor
         U or L from the factorization of A,  as computed by SPTTRF.
\param[in] ANORM
         ANORM is REAL
         The 1-norm of the original matrix A.
\param[out] RCOND
         RCOND is REAL
         The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
         computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is the
         1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
