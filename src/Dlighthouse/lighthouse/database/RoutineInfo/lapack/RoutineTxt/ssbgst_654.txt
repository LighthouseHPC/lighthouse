SSBGST reduces a real symmetric-definite banded generalized
eigenproblem  A*x = lambda*B*x  to standard form  C*y = lambda*y,
such that C has the same bandwidth as A.
B must have been previously factorized as S**T*S by SPBSTF, using a
split Cholesky factorization. A is overwritten by C = X**T*A*X, where
X = S**(-1)*Q and Q is an orthogonal matrix chosen to preserve the
bandwidth of A.
Arguments:
\param[in] VECT
         VECT is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N':  do not form the transformation matrix X;
         = 'V':  form X.
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KA
         KA is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KA >= 0.
\param[in] KB
         KB is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix B if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KA >= KB >= 0.
\param[in,out] AB
         AB is REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band
         matrix A, stored in the first ka+1 rows of the array.  The
         j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
         as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(ka+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ka)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+ka).
         On exit, the transformed matrix X**T*A*X, stored in the same
         format as A.
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KA+1.
\param[in] BB
         BB is REAL array, dimension (LDBB,N)
         The banded factor S from the split Cholesky factorization of
         B, as returned by SPBSTF, stored in the first KB+1 rows of
         the array.
\param[in] LDBB
         LDBB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array BB.  LDBB >= KB+1.
\param[out] X
         X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,N)
         If VECT = 'V', the n-by-n matrix X.
         If VECT = 'N', the array X is not referenced.
\param[in] LDX
         LDX is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array X.
         LDX >= max(1,N) if VECT = 'V'; LDX >= 1 otherwise.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (2*N)
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
