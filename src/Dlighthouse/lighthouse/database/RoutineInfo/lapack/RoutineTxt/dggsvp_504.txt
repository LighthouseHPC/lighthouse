DGGSVP computes orthogonal matrices U, V and Q such that
                   N-K-L  K    L
 U**T*A*Q =     K ( 0    A12  A13 )  if M-K-L >= 0;
                L ( 0     0   A23 )
            M-K-L ( 0     0    0  )
                 N-K-L  K    L
        =     K ( 0    A12  A13 )  if M-K-L < 0;
            M-K ( 0     0   A23 )
                 N-K-L  K    L
 V**T*B*Q =   L ( 0     0   B13 )
            P-L ( 0     0    0  )
where the K-by-K matrix A12 and L-by-L matrix B13 are nonsingular
upper triangular; A23 is L-by-L upper triangular if M-K-L >= 0,
otherwise A23 is (M-K)-by-L upper trapezoidal.  K+L = the effective
numerical rank of the (M+P)-by-N matrix (A**T,B**T)**T. 
This decomposition is the preprocessing step for computing the
Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD), see subroutine
DGGSVD.

\par Further Details:
 The subroutine uses LAPACK subroutine DGEQPF for the QR factorization
 with column pivoting to detect the effective numerical rank of the
 a matrix. It may be replaced by a better rank determination strategy.
