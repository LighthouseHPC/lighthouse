CHPTRF computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian packed
matrix A using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method:
   A = U*D*U**H  or  A = L*D*L**H
where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in,out] AP
         AP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
         On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
         A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
         is stored in the array AP as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
         On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
         to obtain the factor U or L, stored as a packed triangular
         matrix overwriting A (see below for further details).
\param[out] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
         If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
         If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
         columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
         is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
         IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
         interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0: successful exit
         < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
              has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
              exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
              is used to solve a system of equations.
