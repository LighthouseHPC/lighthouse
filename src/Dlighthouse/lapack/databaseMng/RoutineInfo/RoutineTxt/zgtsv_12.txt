ZGTSV  solves the equation
   A*X = B,
where A is an N-by-N tridiagonal matrix, by Gaussian elimination with
partial pivoting.
Note that the equation  A**T *X = B  may be solved by interchanging the
order of the arguments DU and DL.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] DL
         DL is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, DL must contain the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of
         A.
         On exit, DL is overwritten by the (n-2) elements of the
         second superdiagonal of the upper triangular matrix U from
         the LU factorization of A, in DL(1), ..., DL(n-2).
\param[in,out] D
         D is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
         On entry, D must contain the diagonal elements of A.
         On exit, D is overwritten by the n diagonal elements of U.
\param[in,out] DU
         DU is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
         On entry, DU must contain the (n-1) superdiagonal elements
         of A.
         On exit, DU is overwritten by the (n-1) elements of the first
         superdiagonal of U.
\param[in,out] B
         B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero, and the solution
               has not been computed.  The factorization has not been
               completed unless i = N.
