   CLA_HERCOND_C computes the infinity norm condition number of
   op(A) * inv(diag(C)) where C is a REAL vector.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
      = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
      = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
    The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
    matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] A
         A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
    On entry, the N-by-N matrix A
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in] AF
         AF is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAF,N)
    The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
    obtain the factor U or L as computed by CHETRF.
\param[in] LDAF
         LDAF is INTEGER
    The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
\param[in] IPIV
         IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
    Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
    as determined by CHETRF.
\param[in] C
         C is REAL array, dimension (N)
    The vector C in the formula op(A) * inv(diag(C)).
\param[in] CAPPLY
         CAPPLY is LOGICAL
    If .TRUE. then access the vector C in the formula above.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
      = 0:  Successful exit.
    i > 0:  The ith argument is invalid.
\param[in] WORK
         WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N).
    Workspace.
\param[in] RWORK
         RWORK is REAL array, dimension (N).
    Workspace.
