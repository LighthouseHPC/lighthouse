DPBEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
symmetric positive definite band matrix A and reduce its condition
number (with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale factors,
S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.  This
choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the
smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
scalings.
Arguments:
\param[in] UPLO
         UPLO is CHARACTER*1
         = 'U':  Upper triangular of A is stored;
         = 'L':  Lower triangular of A is stored.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] KD
         KD is INTEGER
         The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
         or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
\param[in] AB
         AB is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
         The upper or lower triangle of the symmetric band matrix A,
         stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The j-th column
         of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB as follows:
         if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
         if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
\param[in] LDAB
         LDAB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDAB >= KD+1.
\param[out] S
         S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.
\param[out] SCOND
         SCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
         the largest S(i).  If SCOND >= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
         large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.
\param[out] AMAX
         AMAX is DOUBLE PRECISION
         Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
         close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
         should be scaled.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         > 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element is nonpositive.
