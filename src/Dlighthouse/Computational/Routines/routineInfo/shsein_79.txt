*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SHSEIN uses inverse iteration to find specified right and/or left
*  eigenvectors of a real upper Hessenberg matrix H.
*
*  The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of the matrix H
*  corresponding to an eigenvalue w are defined by:
*
*               H * x = w * x,     y**h * H = w * y**h
*
*  where y**h denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector y.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  SIDE    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'R': compute right eigenvectors only;
*          = 'L': compute left eigenvectors only;
*          = 'B': compute both right and left eigenvectors.
*
*  EIGSRC  (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the source of eigenvalues supplied in (WR,WI):
*          = 'Q': the eigenvalues were found using SHSEQR; thus, if
*                 H has zero subdiagonal elements, and so is
*                 block-triangular, then the j-th eigenvalue can be
*                 assumed to be an eigenvalue of the block containing
*                 the j-th row/column.  This property allows SHSEIN to
*                 perform inverse iteration on just one diagonal block.
*          = 'N': no assumptions are made on the correspondence
*                 between eigenvalues and diagonal blocks.  In this
*                 case, SHSEIN must always perform inverse iteration
*                 using the whole matrix H.
*
*  INITV   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N': no initial vectors are supplied;
*          = 'U': user-supplied initial vectors are stored in the arrays
*                 VL and/or VR.
*
*  SELECT  (input/output) LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
*          Specifies the eigenvectors to be computed. To select the
*          real eigenvector corresponding to a real eigenvalue WR(j),
*          SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE.. To select the complex
*          eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue
*          (WR(j),WI(j)), with complex conjugate (WR(j+1),WI(j+1)),
*          either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) or both must be set to
*          .TRUE.; then on exit SELECT(j) is .TRUE. and SELECT(j+1) is
*          .FALSE..
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix H.  N >= 0.
*
*  H       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDH,N)
*          The upper Hessenberg matrix H.
*
*  LDH     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array H.  LDH >= max(1,N).
*
*  WR      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*  WI      (input) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of
*          H; a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues must be stored in
*          consecutive elements of WR and WI.
*          On exit, WR may have been altered since close eigenvalues
*          are perturbed slightly in searching for independent
*          eigenvectors.
*
*  VL      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDVL,MM)
*          On entry, if INITV = 'U' and SIDE = 'L' or 'B', VL must
*          contain starting vectors for the inverse iteration for the
*          left eigenvectors; the starting vector for each eigenvector
*          must be in the same column(s) in which the eigenvector will
*          be stored.
*          On exit, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B', the left eigenvectors
*          specified by SELECT will be stored consecutively in the
*          columns of VL, in the same order as their eigenvalues. A
*          complex eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue is
*          stored in two consecutive columns, the first holding the real
*          part and the second the imaginary part.
*          If SIDE = 'R', VL is not referenced.
*
*  LDVL    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VL.
*          LDVL >= max(1,N) if SIDE = 'L' or 'B'; LDVL >= 1 otherwise.
*
*  VR      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDVR,MM)
*          On entry, if INITV = 'U' and SIDE = 'R' or 'B', VR must
*          contain starting vectors for the inverse iteration for the
*          right eigenvectors; the starting vector for each eigenvector
*          must be in the same column(s) in which the eigenvector will
*          be stored.
*          On exit, if SIDE = 'R' or 'B', the right eigenvectors
*          specified by SELECT will be stored consecutively in the
*          columns of VR, in the same order as their eigenvalues. A
*          complex eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue is
*          stored in two consecutive columns, the first holding the real
*          part and the second the imaginary part.
*          If SIDE = 'L', VR is not referenced.
*
*  LDVR    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VR.
*          LDVR >= max(1,N) if SIDE = 'R' or 'B'; LDVR >= 1 otherwise.
*
*  MM      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR. MM >= M.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR required to
*          store the eigenvectors; each selected real eigenvector
*          occupies one column and each selected complex eigenvector
*          occupies two columns.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension ((N+2)*N)
*
*  IFAILL  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (MM)
*          If SIDE = 'L' or 'B', IFAILL(i) = j > 0 if the left
*          eigenvector in the i-th column of VL (corresponding to the
*          eigenvalue w(j)) failed to converge; IFAILL(i) = 0 if the
*          eigenvector converged satisfactorily. If the i-th and (i+1)th
*          columns of VL hold a complex eigenvector, then IFAILL(i) and
*          IFAILL(i+1) are set to the same value.
*          If SIDE = 'R', IFAILL is not referenced.
*
*  IFAILR  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (MM)
*          If SIDE = 'R' or 'B', IFAILR(i) = j > 0 if the right
*          eigenvector in the i-th column of VR (corresponding to the
*          eigenvalue w(j)) failed to converge; IFAILR(i) = 0 if the
*          eigenvector converged satisfactorily. If the i-th and (i+1)th
*          columns of VR hold a complex eigenvector, then IFAILR(i) and
*          IFAILR(i+1) are set to the same value.
*          If SIDE = 'L', IFAILR is not referenced.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, i is the number of eigenvectors which
*                failed to converge; see IFAILL and IFAILR for further
*                details.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  Each eigenvector is normalized so that the element of largest
*  magnitude has magnitude 1; here the magnitude of a complex number
*  (x,y) is taken to be |x|+|y|.
