*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CPTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
*  symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix by first factoring the
*  matrix using SPTTRF and then calling CBDSQR to compute the singular
*  values of the bidiagonal factor.
*
*  This routine computes the eigenvalues of the positive definite
*  tridiagonal matrix to high relative accuracy.  This means that if the
*  eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude in size, then the
*  small eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will be computed
*  more accurately than, for example, with the standard QR method.
*
*  The eigenvectors of a full or band positive definite Hermitian matrix
*  can also be found if CHETRD, CHPTRD, or CHBTRD has been used to
*  reduce this matrix to tridiagonal form.  (The reduction to
*  tridiagonal form, however, may preclude the possibility of obtaining
*  high relative accuracy in the small eigenvalues of the original
*  matrix, if these eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude.)
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  COMPZ   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvectors of original Hermitian
*                  matrix also.  Array Z contains the unitary matrix
*                  used to reduce the original matrix to tridiagonal
*                  form.
*          = 'I':  Compute eigenvectors of tridiagonal matrix also.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
*          On normal exit, D contains the eigenvalues, in descending
*          order.
*
*  E       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix.
*          On exit, E has been destroyed.
*
*  Z       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDZ, N)
*          On entry, if COMPZ = 'V', the unitary matrix used in the
*          reduction to tridiagonal form.
*          On exit, if COMPZ = 'V', the orthonormal eigenvectors of the
*          original Hermitian matrix;
*          if COMPZ = 'I', the orthonormal eigenvectors of the
*          tridiagonal matrix.
*          If INFO > 0 on exit, Z contains the eigenvectors associated
*          with only the stored eigenvalues.
*          If  COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          COMPZ = 'V' or 'I', LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (4*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit.
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is:
*                <= N  the Cholesky factorization of the matrix could
*                      not be performed because the i-th principal minor
*                      was not positive definite.
*                > N   the SVD algorithm failed to converge;
*                      if INFO = N+i, i off-diagonal elements of the
*                      bidiagonal factor did not converge to zero.
