*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZUPGTR generates a complex unitary matrix Q which is defined as the
*  product of n-1 elementary reflectors H(i) of order n, as returned by
*  ZHPTRD using packed storage:
*
*  if UPLO = 'U', Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1),
*
*  if UPLO = 'L', Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U': Upper triangular packed storage used in previous
*                 call to ZHPTRD;
*          = 'L': Lower triangular packed storage used in previous
*                 call to ZHPTRD.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix Q. N >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          The vectors which define the elementary reflectors, as
*          returned by ZHPTRD.
*
*  TAU     (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
*          TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
*          reflector H(i), as returned by ZHPTRD.
*
*  Q       (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDQ,N)
*          The N-by-N unitary matrix Q.
*
*  LDQ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Q. LDQ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
