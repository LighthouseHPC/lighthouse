*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSPTRD reduces a real symmetric matrix A stored in packed form to
*  symmetric tridiagonal form T by an orthogonal similarity
*  transformation: Q**T * A * Q = T.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  AP      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
*          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
*          is stored in the array AP as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
*          On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
*          of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
*          tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
*          superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal
*          matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
*          = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
*          written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
*          the array TAU, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product
*          of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.
*
*  D       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
*          D(i) = A(i,i).
*
*  E       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
*          E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.
*
*  TAU     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
*          Details).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*  reflectors
*
*     Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T
*
*  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
*  v(i+1:n) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in AP,
*  overwriting A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau is stored in TAU(i).
*
*  If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*  reflectors
*
*     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T
*
*  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
*  v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in AP,
*  overwriting A(i+2:n,i), and tau is stored in TAU(i).
