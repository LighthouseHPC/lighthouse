*     Purpose
*     =======
*
*     ZHSEQR computes the eigenvalues of a Hessenberg matrix H
*     and, optionally, the matrices T and Z from the Schur decomposition
*     H = Z T Z**H, where T is an upper triangular matrix (the
*     Schur form), and Z is the unitary matrix of Schur vectors.
*
*     Optionally Z may be postmultiplied into an input unitary
*     matrix Q so that this routine can give the Schur factorization
*     of a matrix A which has been reduced to the Hessenberg form H
*     by the unitary matrix Q:  A = Q*H*Q**H = (QZ)*H*(QZ)**H.
*
*     Arguments
*     =========
*
*     JOB   (input) CHARACTER*1
*           = 'E':  compute eigenvalues only;
*           = 'S':  compute eigenvalues and the Schur form T.
*
*     COMPZ (input) CHARACTER*1
*           = 'N':  no Schur vectors are computed;
*           = 'I':  Z is initialized to the unit matrix and the matrix Z
*                   of Schur vectors of H is returned;
*           = 'V':  Z must contain an unitary matrix Q on entry, and
*                   the product Q*Z is returned.
*
*     N     (input) INTEGER
*           The order of the matrix H.  N .GE. 0.
*
*     ILO   (input) INTEGER
*     IHI   (input) INTEGER
*           It is assumed that H is already upper triangular in rows
*           and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N. ILO and IHI are normally
*           set by a previous call to ZGEBAL, and then passed to ZGEHRD
*           when the matrix output by ZGEBAL is reduced to Hessenberg
*           form. Otherwise ILO and IHI should be set to 1 and N
*           respectively.  If N.GT.0, then 1.LE.ILO.LE.IHI.LE.N.
*           If N = 0, then ILO = 1 and IHI = 0.
*
*     H     (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDH,N)
*           On entry, the upper Hessenberg matrix H.
*           On exit, if INFO = 0 and JOB = 'S', H contains the upper
*           triangular matrix T from the Schur decomposition (the
*           Schur form). If INFO = 0 and JOB = 'E', the contents of
*           H are unspecified on exit.  (The output value of H when
*           INFO.GT.0 is given under the description of INFO below.)
*
*           Unlike earlier versions of ZHSEQR, this subroutine may
*           explicitly H(i,j) = 0 for i.GT.j and j = 1, 2, ... ILO-1
*           or j = IHI+1, IHI+2, ... N.
*
*     LDH   (input) INTEGER
*           The leading dimension of the array H. LDH .GE. max(1,N).
*
*     W        (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
*           The computed eigenvalues. If JOB = 'S', the eigenvalues are
*           stored in the same order as on the diagonal of the Schur
*           form returned in H, with W(i) = H(i,i).
*
*     Z     (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ,N)
*           If COMPZ = 'N', Z is not referenced.
*           If COMPZ = 'I', on entry Z need not be set and on exit,
*           if INFO = 0, Z contains the unitary matrix Z of the Schur
*           vectors of H.  If COMPZ = 'V', on entry Z must contain an
*           N-by-N matrix Q, which is assumed to be equal to the unit
*           matrix except for the submatrix Z(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI). On exit,
*           if INFO = 0, Z contains Q*Z.
*           Normally Q is the unitary matrix generated by ZUNGHR
*           after the call to ZGEHRD which formed the Hessenberg matrix
*           H. (The output value of Z when INFO.GT.0 is given under
*           the description of INFO below.)
*
*     LDZ   (input) INTEGER
*           The leading dimension of the array Z.  if COMPZ = 'I' or
*           COMPZ = 'V', then LDZ.GE.MAX(1,N).  Otherwize, LDZ.GE.1.
*
*     WORK  (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LWORK)
*           On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns an estimate of
*           the optimal value for LWORK.
*
*     LWORK (input) INTEGER
*           The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK .GE. max(1,N)
*           is sufficient and delivers very good and sometimes
*           optimal performance.  However, LWORK as large as 11*N
*           may be required for optimal performance.  A workspace
*           query is recommended to determine the optimal workspace
*           size.
*
*           If LWORK = -1, then ZHSEQR does a workspace query.
*           In this case, ZHSEQR checks the input parameters and
*           estimates the optimal workspace size for the given
*           values of N, ILO and IHI.  The estimate is returned
*           in WORK(1).  No error message related to LWORK is
*           issued by XERBLA.  Neither H nor Z are accessed.
*
*
*     INFO  (output) INTEGER
*             =  0:  successful exit
*           .LT. 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
*                    value
*           .GT. 0:  if INFO = i, ZHSEQR failed to compute all of
*                the eigenvalues.  Elements 1:ilo-1 and i+1:n of WR
*                and WI contain those eigenvalues which have been
*                successfully computed.  (Failures are rare.)
*
*                If INFO .GT. 0 and JOB = 'E', then on exit, the
*                remaining unconverged eigenvalues are the eigen-
*                values of the upper Hessenberg matrix rows and
*                columns ILO through INFO of the final, output
*                value of H.
*
*                If INFO .GT. 0 and JOB   = 'S', then on exit
*
*           (*)  (initial value of H)*U  = U*(final value of H)
*
*                where U is a unitary matrix.  The final
*                value of  H is upper Hessenberg and triangular in
*                rows and columns INFO+1 through IHI.
*
*                If INFO .GT. 0 and COMPZ = 'V', then on exit
*
*                  (final value of Z)  =  (initial value of Z)*U
*
*                where U is the unitary matrix in (*) (regard-
*                less of the value of JOB.)
*
*                If INFO .GT. 0 and COMPZ = 'I', then on exit
*                      (final value of Z)  = U
*                where U is the unitary matrix in (*) (regard-
*                less of the value of JOB.)
*
*                If INFO .GT. 0 and COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not
*                accessed.
