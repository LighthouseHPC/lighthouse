*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZSTEIN computes the eigenvectors of a real symmetric tridiagonal
*  matrix T corresponding to specified eigenvalues, using inverse
*  iteration.
*
*  The maximum number of iterations allowed for each eigenvector is
*  specified by an internal parameter MAXITS (currently set to 5).
*
*  Although the eigenvectors are real, they are stored in a complex
*  array, which may be passed to ZUNMTR or ZUPMTR for back
*  transformation to the eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian matrix
*  which was reduced to tridiagonal form.
*
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
*          T, stored in elements 1 to N-1.
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of eigenvectors to be found.  0 <= M <= N.
*
*  W       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The first M elements of W contain the eigenvalues for
*          which eigenvectors are to be computed.  The eigenvalues
*          should be grouped by split-off block and ordered from
*          smallest to largest within the block.  ( The output array
*          W from DSTEBZ with ORDER = 'B' is expected here. )
*
*  IBLOCK  (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The submatrix indices associated with the corresponding
*          eigenvalues in W; IBLOCK(i)=1 if eigenvalue W(i) belongs to
*          the first submatrix from the top, =2 if W(i) belongs to
*          the second submatrix, etc.  ( The output array IBLOCK
*          from DSTEBZ is expected here. )
*
*  ISPLIT  (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The splitting points, at which T breaks up into submatrices.
*          The first submatrix consists of rows/columns 1 to
*          ISPLIT( 1 ), the second of rows/columns ISPLIT( 1 )+1
*          through ISPLIT( 2 ), etc.
*          ( The output array ISPLIT from DSTEBZ is expected here. )
*
*  Z       (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDZ, M)
*          The computed eigenvectors.  The eigenvector associated
*          with the eigenvalue W(i) is stored in the i-th column of
*          Z.  Any vector which fails to converge is set to its current
*          iterate after MAXITS iterations.
*          The imaginary parts of the eigenvectors are set to zero.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (5*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  IFAIL   (output) INTEGER array, dimension (M)
*          On normal exit, all elements of IFAIL are zero.
*          If one or more eigenvectors fail to converge after
*          MAXITS iterations, then their indices are stored in
*          array IFAIL.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, then i eigenvectors failed to converge
*               in MAXITS iterations.  Their indices are stored in
*               array IFAIL.
*
*  Internal Parameters
*  ===================
*
*  MAXITS  INTEGER, default = 5
*          The maximum number of iterations performed.
*
*  EXTRA   INTEGER, default = 2
*          The number of iterations performed after norm growth
*          criterion is satisfied, should be at least 1.
