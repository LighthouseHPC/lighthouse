*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZGEHRD reduces a complex general matrix A to upper Hessenberg form H by
*  an unitary similarity transformation:  Q**H * A * Q = H .
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  ILO     (input) INTEGER
*  IHI     (input) INTEGER
*          It is assumed that A is already upper triangular in rows
*          and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N. ILO and IHI are normally
*          set by a previous call to ZGEBAL; otherwise they should be
*          set to 1 and N respectively. See Further Details.
*          1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N, if N > 0; ILO=1 and IHI=0, if N=0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the N-by-N general matrix to be reduced.
*          On exit, the upper triangle and the first subdiagonal of A
*          are overwritten with the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and the
*          elements below the first subdiagonal, with the array TAU,
*          represent the unitary matrix Q as a product of elementary
*          reflectors. See Further Details.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  TAU     (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
*          Details). Elements 1:ILO-1 and IHI:N-1 of TAU are set to
*          zero.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LWORK)
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N).
*          For optimum performance LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the
*          optimal blocksize.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The matrix Q is represented as a product of (ihi-ilo) elementary
*  reflectors
*
*     Q = H(ilo) H(ilo+1) . . . H(ihi-1).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H
*
*  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
*  v(1:i) = 0, v(i+1) = 1 and v(ihi+1:n) = 0; v(i+2:ihi) is stored on
*  exit in A(i+2:ihi,i), and tau in TAU(i).
*
*  The contents of A are illustrated by the following example, with
*  n = 7, ilo = 2 and ihi = 6:
*
*  on entry,                        on exit,
*
*  ( a   a   a   a   a   a   a )    (  a   a   h   h   h   h   a )
*  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      a   h   h   h   h   a )
*  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      h   h   h   h   h   h )
*  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      v2  h   h   h   h   h )
*  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      v2  v3  h   h   h   h )
*  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      v2  v3  v4  h   h   h )
*  (                         a )    (                          a )
*
*  where a denotes an element of the original matrix A, h denotes a
*  modified element of the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and vi denotes an
*  element of the vector defining H(i).
*
*  This file is a slight modification of LAPACK-3.0's DGEHRD
*  subroutine incorporating improvements proposed by Quintana-Orti and
*  Van de Geijn (2006). (See DLAHR2.)
