*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DTREXC reorders the real Schur factorization of a real matrix
*  A = Q*T*Q**T, so that the diagonal block of T with row index IFST is
*  moved to row ILST.
*
*  The real Schur form T is reordered by an orthogonal similarity
*  transformation Z**T*T*Z, and optionally the matrix Q of Schur vectors
*  is updated by postmultiplying it with Z.
*
*  T must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by DHSEQR), that is,
*  block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each
*  2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
*  off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  COMPQ   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'V':  update the matrix Q of Schur vectors;
*          = 'N':  do not update Q.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.
*
*  T       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDT,N)
*          On entry, the upper quasi-triangular matrix T, in Schur
*          Schur canonical form.
*          On exit, the reordered upper quasi-triangular matrix, again
*          in Schur canonical form.
*
*  LDT     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).
*
*  Q       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDQ,N)
*          On entry, if COMPQ = 'V', the matrix Q of Schur vectors.
*          On exit, if COMPQ = 'V', Q has been postmultiplied by the
*          orthogonal transformation matrix Z which reorders T.
*          If COMPQ = 'N', Q is not referenced.
*
*  LDQ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Q.  LDQ >= max(1,N).
*
*  IFST    (input/output) INTEGER
*  ILST    (input/output) INTEGER
*          Specify the reordering of the diagonal blocks of T.
*          The block with row index IFST is moved to row ILST, by a
*          sequence of transpositions between adjacent blocks.
*          On exit, if IFST pointed on entry to the second row of a
*          2-by-2 block, it is changed to point to the first row; ILST
*          always points to the first row of the block in its final
*          position (which may differ from its input value by +1 or -1).
*          1 <= IFST <= N; 1 <= ILST <= N.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          = 1:  two adjacent blocks were too close to swap (the problem
*                is very ill-conditioned); T may have been partially
*                reordered, and ILST points to the first row of the
*                current position of the block being moved.
