*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CGEBAK forms the right or left eigenvectors of a complex general
*  matrix by backward transformation on the computed eigenvectors of the
*  balanced matrix output by CGEBAL.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOB     (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the type of backward transformation required:
*          = 'N', do nothing, return immediately;
*          = 'P', do backward transformation for permutation only;
*          = 'S', do backward transformation for scaling only;
*          = 'B', do backward transformations for both permutation and
*                 scaling.
*          JOB must be the same as the argument JOB supplied to CGEBAL.
*
*  SIDE    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'R':  V contains right eigenvectors;
*          = 'L':  V contains left eigenvectors.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix V.  N >= 0.
*
*  ILO     (input) INTEGER
*  IHI     (input) INTEGER
*          The integers ILO and IHI determined by CGEBAL.
*          1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N, if N > 0; ILO=1 and IHI=0, if N=0.
*
*  SCALE   (input) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the permutation and scaling factors, as returned
*          by CGEBAL.
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix V.  M >= 0.
*
*  V       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDV,M)
*          On entry, the matrix of right or left eigenvectors to be
*          transformed, as returned by CHSEIN or CTREVC.
*          On exit, V is overwritten by the transformed eigenvectors.
*
*  LDV     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array V. LDV >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
