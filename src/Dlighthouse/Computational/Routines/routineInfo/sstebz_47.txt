*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SSTEBZ computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal
*  matrix T.  The user may ask for all eigenvalues, all eigenvalues
*  in the half-open interval (VL, VU], or the IL-th through IU-th
*  eigenvalues.
*
*  To avoid overflow, the matrix must be scaled so that its
*  largest element is no greater than overflow**(1/2) *
*  underflow**(1/4) in absolute value, and for greatest
*  accuracy, it should not be much smaller than that.
*
*  See W. Kahan "Accurate Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal
*  Matrix", Report CS41, Computer Science Dept., Stanford
*  University, July 21, 1966.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  RANGE   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A': ("All")   all eigenvalues will be found.
*          = 'V': ("Value") all eigenvalues in the half-open interval
*                           (VL, VU] will be found.
*          = 'I': ("Index") the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues (of the
*                           entire matrix) will be found.
*
*  ORDER   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'B': ("By Block") the eigenvalues will be grouped by
*                              split-off block (see IBLOCK, ISPLIT) and
*                              ordered from smallest to largest within
*                              the block.
*          = 'E': ("Entire matrix")
*                              the eigenvalues for the entire matrix
*                              will be ordered from smallest to
*                              largest.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the tridiagonal matrix T.  N >= 0.
*
*  VL      (input) REAL
*  VU      (input) REAL
*          If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
*          be searched for eigenvalues.  Eigenvalues less than or equal
*          to VL, or greater than VU, will not be returned.  VL < VU.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
*
*  IL      (input) INTEGER
*  IU      (input) INTEGER
*          If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
*          smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
*          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
*
*  ABSTOL  (input) REAL
*          The absolute tolerance for the eigenvalues.  An eigenvalue
*          (or cluster) is considered to be located if it has been
*          determined to lie in an interval whose width is ABSTOL or
*          less.  If ABSTOL is less than or equal to zero, then ULP*|T|
*          will be used, where |T| means the 1-norm of T.
*
*          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
*          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.
*
*  D       (input) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  E       (input) REAL array, dimension (N-1)
*          The (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The actual number of eigenvalues found. 0 <= M <= N.
*          (See also the description of INFO=2,3.)
*
*  NSPLIT  (output) INTEGER
*          The number of diagonal blocks in the matrix T.
*          1 <= NSPLIT <= N.
*
*  W       (output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          On exit, the first M elements of W will contain the
*          eigenvalues.  (SSTEBZ may use the remaining N-M elements as
*          workspace.)
*
*  IBLOCK  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          At each row/column j where E(j) is zero or small, the
*          matrix T is considered to split into a block diagonal
*          matrix.  On exit, if INFO = 0, IBLOCK(i) specifies to which
*          block (from 1 to the number of blocks) the eigenvalue W(i)
*          belongs.  (SSTEBZ may use the remaining N-M elements as
*          workspace.)
*
*  ISPLIT  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The splitting points, at which T breaks up into submatrices.
*          The first submatrix consists of rows/columns 1 to ISPLIT(1),
*          the second of rows/columns ISPLIT(1)+1 through ISPLIT(2),
*          etc., and the NSPLIT-th consists of rows/columns
*          ISPLIT(NSPLIT-1)+1 through ISPLIT(NSPLIT)=N.
*          (Only the first NSPLIT elements will actually be used, but
*          since the user cannot know a priori what value NSPLIT will
*          have, N words must be reserved for ISPLIT.)
*
*  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (4*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  some or all of the eigenvalues failed to converge or
*                were not computed:
*                =1 or 3: Bisection failed to converge for some
*                        eigenvalues; these eigenvalues are flagged by a
*                        negative block number.  The effect is that the
*                        eigenvalues may not be as accurate as the
*                        absolute and relative tolerances.  This is
*                        generally caused by unexpectedly inaccurate
*                        arithmetic.
*                =2 or 3: RANGE='I' only: Not all of the eigenvalues
*                        IL:IU were found.
*                        Effect: M < IU+1-IL
*                        Cause:  non-monotonic arithmetic, causing the
*                                Sturm sequence to be non-monotonic.
*                        Cure:   recalculate, using RANGE='A', and pick
*                                out eigenvalues IL:IU.  In some cases,
*                                increasing the PARAMETER "FUDGE" may
*                                make things work.
*                = 4:    RANGE='I', and the Gershgorin interval
*                        initially used was too small.  No eigenvalues
*                        were computed.
*                        Probable cause: your machine has sloppy
*                                        floating-point arithmetic.
*                        Cure: Increase the PARAMETER "FUDGE",
*                              recompile, and try again.
*
*  Internal Parameters
*  ===================
*
*  RELFAC  REAL, default = 2.0e0
*          The relative tolerance.  An interval (a,b] lies within
*          "relative tolerance" if  b-a < RELFAC*ulp*max(|a|,|b|),
*          where "ulp" is the machine precision (distance from 1 to
*          the next larger floating point number.)
*
*  FUDGE   REAL, default = 2
*          A "fudge factor" to widen the Gershgorin intervals.  Ideally,
*          a value of 1 should work, but on machines with sloppy
*          arithmetic, this needs to be larger.  The default for
*          publicly released versions should be large enough to handle
*          the worst machine around.  Note that this has no effect
*          on accuracy of the solution.
