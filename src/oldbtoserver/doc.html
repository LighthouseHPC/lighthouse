The implementation uses the SocketServer library which comes with Python.
It basically requires the server's tasks to be implemented within the handle()
method.
<br>The structure of the server is summarized in the following class diagram
where each class is represented by a box containing the name of the class
(bold letters) and important methods (black small font). Important data
that is used by other classes is indicated by small magenta font, e.g.,
the rfile and wfile objects which are used to read/write data from/to the
socket. The blue circled classes can be found in the file Base.py. The
green and red circled class(es) are located in the files XAIF.py and xaif_server.py
respectively. The latter also contains the actual main program. More information
about the methods can be found in the respective files. The remaining classes
(BaseRequestHandler, StreamRequestHandler, ForkingTCPServer, TCPServer,
ForkingMixIn and BaseServer) are part of the SocketServer library. Note
that the BaseServer classes in the files Base.py and SocketServer.py have
different purposes (sorry - I have discovered this coincidence just today.
It means nothing!).

<p>The XAIF_Client, located in XAIF.py, simply extends the BaseClient by
one method called submit1 (which is used in file xaif_client.py).
<p>The ADIC-specific versions look quite similar, except for the slightly
different structure of ADIC.py: here the ADIC_Server and the ADIC_Client
both inherit from a common superclass ADIC . Furthermore, the server overwrites
the check_options, send1, and recv1 methods. The client also overwrites
check_options. See file ADIC.py for details. The class diagram can be found
<a href="adic.jpg">here</a>.

<p>Notes on the Message class (see file: <a href="Base.py">Base.py</a>)
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>A message has two main sections: the Header section, and&nbsp; the
Files (data)&nbsp; section. The header consists of a sequence of text lines,
and each line is associated to a specific header field. The header of a
request sent from a client to a server has the following items:
<ul>
<li>
userid: user name</li>

<li>
options: command-line options for the AD tool (should be verified by the
server before execution, see ADIC for example)</li>

<li>
numfiles: an integer indicating the total number of files in the data section</li>
</ul>
The header of the returning message to the client has only one field: numfiles
(i.e., the number of files to be send).
<p>In general, the protocol for sending/receiving one file is: &lt;filename>
&lt;blank> &lt;size of file content (number of bytes) > &lt;newline> followed
by exactly the number of bytes specified.
<p>The following methods are available in the BaseMessage class:
<br>send_header1(header_item): send one line
<br>recv_header1(): receive one header line
<br>send_header([list_of_header_items]): send multiple header lines
<br>send(list_of_files): send all files named in the list
<br>send1(filename, data): send name and content of one file
<br>recv(n): receive complete data section where n=#files, and save them
to disk
<br>recv1(): receive name and content of one file
<br>read1(filename): read file from disk
<br>write1(filename,data): write file to disk
<p>There is also a simple verification protocol that requires a receipt
("ok") after every header_item or file.&nbsp; The methods send_receipt(),
recv_receipt(), and send_error() are used for this.
<p>Notes on the BaseServer class (see file: <a href="Base.py">Base.py</a>)
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>A server typically performs the following operations to serve a client's
request:
<br>1. receive header (userid,options,numfiles)
<br>2. check user id
<br>3. check options
<br>4. create working directory
<br>5. receive source files
<br>6. execute AD tool in working directory
<br>7. send results (new source files, log files, etc.) to client
<br>8. remove working directory
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Notes on the Driver (see file: <a href="adic_server.py">adic_server.py</a>
or <a href="xaif_server.py">xaif_server.py</a>)
<br>--------------------------
<br>On start the server forks a child process regularly sending CPU load
information to the scheduler. When the server gets a termination signal,&nbsp;
it informs the scheduler and also kills the child process.
<br>The actual server implementation is based on the SocketServer library
which provides a general framework for request-based servers.We use a forking
TCP server where every request is served by a new child process. See description
of the SocketServer module for details. The handle() method, a member of
the RequestHandler class, defines the server actions to be performed by
a child process (e.g., steps 1.-8.).
<br>The server can handle multiple requests at a time. The SocketServer
module cares about creating and terminating child processes.
<p>Note that the files adic_server.py and xaif_server.py are quite similar
where the main difference is in the handle() method: the adic version uses
the do_all(exe) method provided by the BaseServer class where xaif_server.py
uses a sequence of statements in order to comply with the special requirements
for xaifbooster (local directory must contain xsd file). In fact, all these
statements could also be implemented in a new do_all(exe) method overwriting
the one from the BaseServer class. This way, the drivers will be nearly
identical.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>How to write a new server for tool "XY":
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<br>Write XY_Server and XY_Client classes inheriting from BaseServer and
BaseClient resp. (see files XAIF.py and ADIC.py for examples). Tool-specific
data like legal_options or legal_longoptions should be provided here. You
may also overwrite e.g., the do_all(exe) method, or, like in case of the
ADIC_Server, the send1(filename,data) and recv1() methods. See ADIC.py
for a description. ADIC _Server also overwrites the original check_options(options)
method. ADIC_Client introduces a new check_options(args) method which additionally
reads the "SOURCE_FILES" section of the ADIC-init script (if provided),
and adds the&nbsp; source files to the list of filenames. This is simply
for the convenience of the user, and not really necessary, in contrast
to the check_options the server's side.
