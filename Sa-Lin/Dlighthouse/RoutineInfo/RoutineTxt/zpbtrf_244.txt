*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZPBTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a complex Hermitian
*  positive definite band matrix A.
*
*  The factorization has the form
*     A = U**H * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*     A = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  KD      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',
*          or the number of subdiagonals if UPLO = 'L'.  KD >= 0.
*
*  AB      (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB,N)
*          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band
*          matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
*          j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
*          as follows:
*          if UPLO = 'U', AB(kd+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-kd)<=i<=j;
*          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(n,j+kd).
*
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the
*          Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the band
*          matrix A, in the same storage format as A.
*
*  LDAB    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KD+1.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
*                positive definite, and the factorization could not be
*                completed.
