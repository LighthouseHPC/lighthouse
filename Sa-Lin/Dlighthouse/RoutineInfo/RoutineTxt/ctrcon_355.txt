*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CTRCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a
*  triangular matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.
*
*  The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
*  norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
*  computed as
*     RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
*          infinity-norm condition number is required:
*          = '1' or 'O':  1-norm;
*          = 'I':         Infinity-norm.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
*          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.
*
*  DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
*          = 'U':  A is unit triangular.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
*          upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper
*          triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of
*          A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
*          triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular
*          matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
*          referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are
*          also not referenced and are assumed to be 1.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  RCOND   (output) REAL
*          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
*          computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
