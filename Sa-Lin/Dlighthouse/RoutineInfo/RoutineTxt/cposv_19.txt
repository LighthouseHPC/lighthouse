*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CPOSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
*     A * X = B,
*  where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite matrix and X and B
*  are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*
*  The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as
*     A = U**H* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
*     A = L * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
*  where U is an upper triangular matrix and  L is a lower triangular
*  matrix.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of
*  equations A * X = B.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*          matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
*          factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  B       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i of A is not
*                positive definite, so the factorization could not be
*                completed, and the solution has not been computed.
