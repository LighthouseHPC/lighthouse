*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CTREVC computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
*  a complex upper triangular matrix T.
*  Matrices of this type are produced by the Schur factorization of
*  a complex general matrix:  A = Q*T*Q**H, as computed by CHSEQR.
*  
*  The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of T corresponding
*  to an eigenvalue w are defined by:
*  
*               T*x = w*x,     (y**H)*T = w*(y**H)
*  
*  where y**H denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector y.
*  The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are read directly
*  from the diagonal of T.
*  
*  This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
*  eigenvectors of T, or the products Q*X and/or Q*Y, where Q is an
*  input matrix.  If Q is the unitary factor that reduces a matrix A to
*  Schur form T, then Q*X and Q*Y are the matrices of right and left
*  eigenvectors of A.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  SIDE    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'R':  compute right eigenvectors only;
*          = 'L':  compute left eigenvectors only;
*          = 'B':  compute both right and left eigenvectors.
*
*  HOWMNY  (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A':  compute all right and/or left eigenvectors;
*          = 'B':  compute all right and/or left eigenvectors,
*                  backtransformed using the matrices supplied in
*                  VR and/or VL;
*          = 'S':  compute selected right and/or left eigenvectors,
*                  as indicated by the logical array SELECT.
*
*  SELECT  (input) LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
*          If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the eigenvectors to be
*          computed.
*          The eigenvector corresponding to the j-th eigenvalue is
*          computed if SELECT(j) = .TRUE..
*          Not referenced if HOWMNY = 'A' or 'B'.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.
*
*  T       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDT,N)
*          The upper triangular matrix T.  T is modified, but restored
*          on exit.
*
*  LDT     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).
*
*  VL      (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVL,MM)
*          On entry, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B' and HOWMNY = 'B', VL must
*          contain an N-by-N matrix Q (usually the unitary matrix Q of
*          Schur vectors returned by CHSEQR).
*          On exit, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B', VL contains:
*          if HOWMNY = 'A', the matrix Y of left eigenvectors of T;
*          if HOWMNY = 'B', the matrix Q*Y;
*          if HOWMNY = 'S', the left eigenvectors of T specified by
*                           SELECT, stored consecutively in the columns
*                           of VL, in the same order as their
*                           eigenvalues.
*          Not referenced if SIDE = 'R'.
*
*  LDVL    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VL.  LDVL >= 1, and if
*          SIDE = 'L' or 'B', LDVL >= N.
*
*  VR      (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDVR,MM)
*          On entry, if SIDE = 'R' or 'B' and HOWMNY = 'B', VR must
*          contain an N-by-N matrix Q (usually the unitary matrix Q of
*          Schur vectors returned by CHSEQR).
*          On exit, if SIDE = 'R' or 'B', VR contains:
*          if HOWMNY = 'A', the matrix X of right eigenvectors of T;
*          if HOWMNY = 'B', the matrix Q*X;
*          if HOWMNY = 'S', the right eigenvectors of T specified by
*                           SELECT, stored consecutively in the columns
*                           of VR, in the same order as their
*                           eigenvalues.
*          Not referenced if SIDE = 'L'.
*
*  LDVR    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VR.  LDVR >= 1, and if
*          SIDE = 'R' or 'B'; LDVR >= N.
*
*  MM      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR. MM >= M.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR actually
*          used to store the eigenvectors.  If HOWMNY = 'A' or 'B', M
*          is set to N.  Each selected eigenvector occupies one
*          column.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX array, dimension (2*N)
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) REAL array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The algorithm used in this program is basically backward (forward)
*  substitution, with scaling to make the the code robust against
*  possible overflow.
*
*  Each eigenvector is normalized so that the element of largest
*  magnitude has magnitude 1; here the magnitude of a complex number
*  (x,y) is taken to be |x| + |y|.
