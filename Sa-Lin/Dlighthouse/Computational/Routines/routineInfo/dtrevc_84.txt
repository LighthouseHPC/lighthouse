*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DTREVC computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
*  a real upper quasi-triangular matrix T.
*  Matrices of this type are produced by the Schur factorization of
*  a real general matrix:  A = Q*T*Q**T, as computed by DHSEQR.
*  
*  The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of T corresponding
*  to an eigenvalue w are defined by:
*  
*     T*x = w*x,     (y**T)*T = w*(y**T)
*  
*  where y**T denotes the transpose of y.
*  The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are read directly
*  from the diagonal blocks of T.
*  
*  This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
*  eigenvectors of T, or the products Q*X and/or Q*Y, where Q is an
*  input matrix.  If Q is the orthogonal factor that reduces a matrix
*  A to Schur form T, then Q*X and Q*Y are the matrices of right and
*  left eigenvectors of A.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  SIDE    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'R':  compute right eigenvectors only;
*          = 'L':  compute left eigenvectors only;
*          = 'B':  compute both right and left eigenvectors.
*
*  HOWMNY  (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A':  compute all right and/or left eigenvectors;
*          = 'B':  compute all right and/or left eigenvectors,
*                  backtransformed by the matrices in VR and/or VL;
*          = 'S':  compute selected right and/or left eigenvectors,
*                  as indicated by the logical array SELECT.
*
*  SELECT  (input/output) LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
*          If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the eigenvectors to be
*          computed.
*          If w(j) is a real eigenvalue, the corresponding real
*          eigenvector is computed if SELECT(j) is .TRUE..
*          If w(j) and w(j+1) are the real and imaginary parts of a
*          complex eigenvalue, the corresponding complex eigenvector is
*          computed if either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) is .TRUE., and
*          on exit SELECT(j) is set to .TRUE. and SELECT(j+1) is set to
*          .FALSE..
*          Not referenced if HOWMNY = 'A' or 'B'.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.
*
*  T       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDT,N)
*          The upper quasi-triangular matrix T in Schur canonical form.
*

*          The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).
*
*  VL      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVL,MM)
*          On entry, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B' and HOWMNY = 'B', VL must
*          contain an N-by-N matrix Q (usually the orthogonal matrix Q
*          of Schur vectors returned by DHSEQR).
*          On exit, if SIDE = 'L' or 'B', VL contains:
*          if HOWMNY = 'A', the matrix Y of left eigenvectors of T;
*          if HOWMNY = 'B', the matrix Q*Y;
*          if HOWMNY = 'S', the left eigenvectors of T specified by
*                           SELECT, stored consecutively in the columns
*                           of VL, in the same order as their
*                           eigenvalues.
*          A complex eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue
*          is stored in two consecutive columns, the first holding the
*          real part, and the second the imaginary part.
*          Not referenced if SIDE = 'R'.
*
*  LDVL    (input) INTEGER

*          On entry, if SIDE = 'R' or 'B' and HOWMNY = 'B', VR must
*          contain an N-by-N matrix Q (usually the orthogonal matrix Q
*          of Schur vectors returned by DHSEQR).
*          On exit, if SIDE = 'R' or 'B', VR contains:
*          if HOWMNY = 'A', the matrix X of right eigenvectors of T;
*          if HOWMNY = 'B', the matrix Q*X;
*          if HOWMNY = 'S', the right eigenvectors of T specified by
*                           SELECT, stored consecutively in the columns
*                           of VR, in the same order as their
*                           eigenvalues.
*          A complex eigenvector corresponding to a complex eigenvalue
*          is stored in two consecutive columns, the first holding the
*          real part and the second the imaginary part.
*          Not referenced if SIDE = 'L'.
*
*  LDVR    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VR.  LDVR >= 1, and if
*          SIDE = 'R' or 'B', LDVR >= N.
*

*          The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR. MM >= M.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR actually
*          used to store the eigenvectors.
*          If HOWMNY = 'A' or 'B', M is set to N.
*          Each selected real eigenvector occupies one column and each
*          selected complex eigenvector occupies two columns.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The algorithm used in this program is basically backward (forward)
*  substitution, with scaling to make the the code robust against
*  possible overflow.
*
*  Each eigenvector is normalized so that the element of largest
*  magnitude has magnitude 1; here the magnitude of a complex number
*  (x,y) is taken to be |x| + |y|.
