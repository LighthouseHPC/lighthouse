*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CGGBAK forms the right or left eigenvectors of a complex generalized
*  eigenvalue problem A*x = lambda*B*x, by backward transformation on
*  the computed eigenvectors of the balanced pair of matrices output by
*  CGGBAL.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOB     (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the type of backward transformation required:
*          = 'N':  do nothing, return immediately;
*          = 'P':  do backward transformation for permutation only;
*          = 'S':  do backward transformation for scaling only;
*          = 'B':  do backward transformations for both permutation and
*                  scaling.
*          JOB must be the same as the argument JOB supplied to CGGBAL.
*
*  SIDE    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'R':  V contains right eigenvectors;
*          = 'L':  V contains left eigenvectors.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix V.  N >= 0.
*
*  ILO     (input) INTEGER
*  IHI     (input) INTEGER
*          The integers ILO and IHI determined by CGGBAL.
*          1 <= ILO <= IHI <= N, if N > 0; ILO=1 and IHI=0, if N=0.
*
*  LSCALE  (input) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the permutations and/or scaling factors applied
*          to the left side of A and B, as returned by CGGBAL.
*
*  RSCALE  (input) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          Details of the permutations and/or scaling factors applied
*          to the right side of A and B, as returned by CGGBAL.
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix V.  M >= 0.
*
*  V       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDV,M)
*          On entry, the matrix of right or left eigenvectors to be
*          transformed, as returned by CTGEVC.
*          On exit, V is overwritten by the transformed eigenvectors.
*
*  LDV     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the matrix V. LDV >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit.
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
