*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  CSTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
*  symmetric tridiagonal matrix using the implicit QL or QR method.
*  The eigenvectors of a full or band complex Hermitian matrix can also
*  be found if CHETRD or CHPTRD or CHBTRD has been used to reduce this
*  matrix to tridiagonal form.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  COMPZ   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original
*                  Hermitian matrix.  On entry, Z must contain the
*                  unitary matrix used to reduce the original matrix
*                  to tridiagonal form.
*          = 'I':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
*                  tridiagonal matrix.  Z is initialized to the identity
*                  matrix.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
*
*  E       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix.
*          On exit, E has been destroyed.
*
*  Z       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDZ, N)
*          On entry, if  COMPZ = 'V', then Z contains the unitary
*          matrix used in the reduction to tridiagonal form.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, then if COMPZ = 'V', Z contains the
*          orthonormal eigenvectors of the original Hermitian matrix,
*          and if COMPZ = 'I', Z contains the orthonormal eigenvectors
*          of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
*          If COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          eigenvectors are desired, then  LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (max(1,2*N-2))
*          If COMPZ = 'N', then WORK is not referenced.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  the algorithm has failed to find all the eigenvalues in
*                a total of 30*N iterations; if INFO = i, then i
*                elements of E have not converged to zero; on exit, D
*                and E contain the elements of a symmetric tridiagonal
*                matrix which is unitarily similar to the original
*                matrix.
