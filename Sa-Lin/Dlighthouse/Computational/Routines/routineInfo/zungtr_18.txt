*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZUNGTR generates a complex unitary matrix Q which is defined as the
*  product of n-1 elementary reflectors of order N, as returned by
*  ZHETRD:
*
*  if UPLO = 'U', Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1),
*
*  if UPLO = 'L', Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U': Upper triangle of A contains elementary reflectors
*                 from ZHETRD;
*          = 'L': Lower triangle of A contains elementary reflectors
*                 from ZHETRD.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix Q. N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the vectors which define the elementary reflectors,
*          as returned by ZHETRD.
*          On exit, the N-by-N unitary matrix Q.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= N.
*
*  TAU     (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
*          TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
*          reflector H(i), as returned by ZHETRD.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= N-1.
*          For optimum performance LWORK >= (N-1)*NB, where NB is
*          the optimal blocksize.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
