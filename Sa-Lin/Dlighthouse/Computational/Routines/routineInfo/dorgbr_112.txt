*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DORGBR generates one of the real orthogonal matrices Q or P**T
*  determined by DGEBRD when reducing a real matrix A to bidiagonal
*  form: A = Q * B * P**T.  Q and P**T are defined as products of
*  elementary reflectors H(i) or G(i) respectively.
*
*  If VECT = 'Q', A is assumed to have been an M-by-K matrix, and Q
*  is of order M:
*  if m >= k, Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k) and DORGBR returns the first n
*  columns of Q, where m >= n >= k;
*  if m < k, Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(m-1) and DORGBR returns Q as an
*  M-by-M matrix.
*
*  If VECT = 'P', A is assumed to have been a K-by-N matrix, and P**T
*  is of order N:
*  if k < n, P**T = G(k) . . . G(2) G(1) and DORGBR returns the first m
*  rows of P**T, where n >= m >= k;
*  if k >= n, P**T = G(n-1) . . . G(2) G(1) and DORGBR returns P**T as
*  an N-by-N matrix.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  VECT    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the matrix Q or the matrix P**T is
*          required, as defined in the transformation applied by DGEBRD:
*          = 'Q':  generate Q;
*          = 'P':  generate P**T.
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix Q or P**T to be returned.
*          M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix Q or P**T to be returned.
*          N >= 0.
*          If VECT = 'Q', M >= N >= min(M,K);
*          if VECT = 'P', N >= M >= min(N,K).
*
*  K       (input) INTEGER
*          If VECT = 'Q', the number of columns in the original M-by-K
*          matrix reduced by DGEBRD.
*          If VECT = 'P', the number of rows in the original K-by-N
*          matrix reduced by DGEBRD.
*          K >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the vectors which define the elementary reflectors,
*          as returned by DGEBRD.
*          On exit, the M-by-N matrix Q or P**T.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  TAU     (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension
*                                (min(M,K)) if VECT = 'Q'
*                                (min(N,K)) if VECT = 'P'
*          TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
*          reflector H(i) or G(i), which determines Q or P**T, as
*          returned by DGEBRD in its array argument TAUQ or TAUP.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,min(M,N)).
*          For optimum performance LWORK >= min(M,N)*NB, where NB
*          is the optimal blocksize.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
