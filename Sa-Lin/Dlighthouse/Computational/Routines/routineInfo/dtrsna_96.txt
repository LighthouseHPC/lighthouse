*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DTRSNA estimates reciprocal condition numbers for specified
*  eigenvalues and/or right eigenvectors of a real upper
*  quasi-triangular matrix T (or of any matrix Q*T*Q**T with Q
*  orthogonal).
*
*  T must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by DHSEQR), that is,
*  block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each
*  2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
*  off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOB     (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether condition numbers are required for
*          eigenvalues (S) or eigenvectors (SEP):
*          = 'E': for eigenvalues only (S);
*          = 'V': for eigenvectors only (SEP);
*          = 'B': for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors (S and SEP).
*
*  HOWMNY  (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A': compute condition numbers for all eigenpairs;
*          = 'S': compute condition numbers for selected eigenpairs
*                 specified by the array SELECT.
*
*  SELECT  (input) LOGICAL array, dimension (N)
*          If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the eigenpairs for which
*          condition numbers are required. To select condition numbers
*          for the eigenpair corresponding to a real eigenvalue w(j),
*          SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE.. To select condition numbers
*          corresponding to a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues w(j)
*          and w(j+1), either SELECT(j) or SELECT(j+1) or both, must be
*          set to .TRUE..
*          If HOWMNY = 'A', SELECT is not referenced.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix T. N >= 0.
*
*  T       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDT,N)
*          The upper quasi-triangular matrix T, in Schur canonical form.
*
*  LDT     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array T. LDT >= max(1,N).
*
*  VL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVL,M)
*          If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VL must contain left eigenvectors of T
*          (or of any Q*T*Q**T with Q orthogonal), corresponding to the
*          eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY and SELECT. The eigenvectors
*          must be stored in consecutive columns of VL, as returned by
*          DHSEIN or DTREVC.
*          If JOB = 'V', VL is not referenced.
*
*  LDVL    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VL.
*          LDVL >= 1; and if JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVL >= N.
*
*  VR      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDVR,M)
*          If JOB = 'E' or 'B', VR must contain right eigenvectors of T
*          (or of any Q*T*Q**T with Q orthogonal), corresponding to the
*          eigenpairs specified by HOWMNY and SELECT. The eigenvectors
*          must be stored in consecutive columns of VR, as returned by
*          DHSEIN or DTREVC.
*          If JOB = 'V', VR is not referenced.
*
*  LDVR    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VR.
*          LDVR >= 1; and if JOB = 'E' or 'B', LDVR >= N.
*
*  S       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MM)
*          If JOB = 'E' or 'B', the reciprocal condition numbers of the
*          selected eigenvalues, stored in consecutive elements of the
*          array. For a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues two
*          consecutive elements of S are set to the same value. Thus
*          S(j), SEP(j), and the j-th columns of VL and VR all
*          correspond to the same eigenpair (but not in general the
*          j-th eigenpair, unless all eigenpairs are selected).
*          If JOB = 'V', S is not referenced.
*
*  SEP     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MM)
*          If JOB = 'V' or 'B', the estimated reciprocal condition
*          numbers of the selected eigenvectors, stored in consecutive
*          elements of the array. For a complex eigenvector two
*          consecutive elements of SEP are set to the same value. If
*          the eigenvalues cannot be reordered to compute SEP(j), SEP(j)
*          is set to 0; this can only occur when the true value would be
*          very small anyway.
*          If JOB = 'E', SEP is not referenced.
*
*  MM      (input) INTEGER
*          The number of elements in the arrays S (if JOB = 'E' or 'B')
*           and/or SEP (if JOB = 'V' or 'B'). MM >= M.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The number of elements of the arrays S and/or SEP actually
*          used to store the estimated condition numbers.
*          If HOWMNY = 'A', M is set to N.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK,N+6)
*          If JOB = 'E', WORK is not referenced.
*
*  LDWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array WORK.
*          LDWORK >= 1; and if JOB = 'V' or 'B', LDWORK >= N.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (2*(N-1))
*          If JOB = 'E', IWORK is not referenced.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The reciprocal of the condition number of an eigenvalue lambda is
*  defined as
*
*          S(lambda) = |v**T*u| / (norm(u)*norm(v))
*
*  where u and v are the right and left eigenvectors of T corresponding
*  to lambda; v**T denotes the transpose of v, and norm(u)
*  denotes the Euclidean norm. These reciprocal condition numbers always
*  lie between zero (very badly conditioned) and one (very well
*  conditioned). If n = 1, S(lambda) is defined to be 1.
*
*  An approximate error bound for a computed eigenvalue W(i) is given by
*
*                      EPS * norm(T) / S(i)
*
*  where EPS is the machine precision.
*
*  The reciprocal of the condition number of the right eigenvector u
*  corresponding to lambda is defined as follows. Suppose
*
*              T = ( lambda  c  )
*                  (   0    T22 )
*
*  Then the reciprocal condition number is
*
*          SEP( lambda, T22 ) = sigma-min( T22 - lambda*I )
*
*  where sigma-min denotes the smallest singular value. We approximate
*  the smallest singular value by the reciprocal of an estimate of the
*  one-norm of the inverse of T22 - lambda*I. If n = 1, SEP(1) is
*  defined to be abs(T(1,1)).
*
*  An approximate error bound for a computed right eigenvector VR(i)
*  is given by
*
*                      EPS * norm(T) / SEP(i)
*
