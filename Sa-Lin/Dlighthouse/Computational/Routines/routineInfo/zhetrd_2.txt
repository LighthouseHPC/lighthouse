*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZHETRD reduces a complex Hermitian matrix A to real symmetric
*  tridiagonal form T by a unitary similarity transformation:
*  Q**H * A * Q = T.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*          On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
*          of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
*          tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
*          superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the unitary
*          matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
*          = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
*          written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
*          the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q as a product
*          of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  D       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
*          D(i) = A(i,i).
*
*  E       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
*          E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.
*
*  TAU     (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
*          Details).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= 1.
*          For optimum performance LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the
*          optimal blocksize.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*  reflectors
*
*     Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H
*
*  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
*  v(i+1:n) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in
*  A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau in TAU(i).
*
*  If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*  reflectors
*
*     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H
*
*  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
*  v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in A(i+2:n,i),
*  and tau in TAU(i).
*
*  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
*  with n = 5:
*
*  if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':
*
*    (  d   e   v2  v3  v4 )              (  d                  )
*    (      d   e   v3  v4 )              (  e   d              )
*    (          d   e   v4 )              (  v1  e   d          )
*    (              d   e  )              (  v1  v2  e   d      )
*    (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  v3  e   d  )
*
*  where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of T, and vi
*  denotes an element of the vector defining H(i).
