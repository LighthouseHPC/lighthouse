*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZGESDD computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a complex
*  M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and/or right singular
*  vectors, by using divide-and-conquer method. The SVD is written
*
*       A = U * SIGMA * conjugate-transpose(V)
*
*  where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its
*  min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M unitary matrix, and
*  V is an N-by-N unitary matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA
*  are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and
*  are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of
*  U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.
*
*  Note that the routine returns VT = V**H, not V.
*
*  The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
*  floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
*  digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
*  digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
*  Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
*  without guard digits, but we know of none.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies options for computing all or part of the matrix U:
*          = 'A':  all M columns of U and all N rows of V**H are
*                  returned in the arrays U and VT;
*          = 'S':  the first min(M,N) columns of U and the first
*                  min(M,N) rows of V**H are returned in the arrays U
*                  and VT;
*          = 'O':  If M >= N, the first N columns of U are overwritten
*                  in the array A and all rows of V**H are returned in
*                  the array VT;
*                  otherwise, all columns of U are returned in the
*                  array U and the first M rows of V**H are overwritten
*                  in the array A;
*          = 'N':  no columns of U or rows of V**H are computed.
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the input matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the input matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
*          On exit,
*          if JOBZ = 'O',  A is overwritten with the first N columns
*                          of U (the left singular vectors, stored
*                          columnwise) if M >= N;
*                          A is overwritten with the first M rows
*                          of V**H (the right singular vectors, stored
*                          rowwise) otherwise.
*          if JOBZ .ne. 'O', the contents of A are destroyed.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  S       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The singular values of A, sorted so that S(i) >= S(i+1).
*
*  U       (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDU,UCOL)
*          UCOL = M if JOBZ = 'A' or JOBZ = 'O' and M < N;
*          UCOL = min(M,N) if JOBZ = 'S'.
*          If JOBZ = 'A' or JOBZ = 'O' and M < N, U contains the M-by-M
*          unitary matrix U;
*          if JOBZ = 'S', U contains the first min(M,N) columns of U
*          (the left singular vectors, stored columnwise);
*          if JOBZ = 'O' and M >= N, or JOBZ = 'N', U is not referenced.
*
*  LDU     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array U.  LDU >= 1; if
*          JOBZ = 'S' or 'A' or JOBZ = 'O' and M < N, LDU >= M.
*
*  VT      (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDVT,N)
*          If JOBZ = 'A' or JOBZ = 'O' and M >= N, VT contains the
*          N-by-N unitary matrix V**H;
*          if JOBZ = 'S', VT contains the first min(M,N) rows of
*          V**H (the right singular vectors, stored rowwise);
*          if JOBZ = 'O' and M < N, or JOBZ = 'N', VT is not referenced.
*
*  LDVT    (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array VT.  LDVT >= 1; if
*          JOBZ = 'A' or JOBZ = 'O' and M >= N, LDVT >= N;
*          if JOBZ = 'S', LDVT >= min(M,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= 1.
*          if JOBZ = 'N', LWORK >= 2*min(M,N)+max(M,N).
*          if JOBZ = 'O',
*                LWORK >= 2*min(M,N)*min(M,N)+2*min(M,N)+max(M,N).
*          if JOBZ = 'S' or 'A',
*                LWORK >= min(M,N)*min(M,N)+2*min(M,N)+max(M,N).
*          For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, a workspace query is assumed.  The optimal
*          size for the WORK array is calculated and stored in WORK(1),
*          and no other work except argument checking is performed.
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LRWORK))
*          If JOBZ = 'N', LRWORK >= 5*min(M,N).
*          Otherwise,

*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (8*min(M,N))
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit.
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*          > 0:  The updating process of DBDSDC did not converge.
