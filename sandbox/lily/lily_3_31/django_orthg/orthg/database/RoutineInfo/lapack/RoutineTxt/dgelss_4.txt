DGELSS computes the minimum norm solution to a real linear least
squares problem:
Minimize 2-norm(| b - A*x |).
using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. A is an M-by-N
matrix which may be rank-deficient.
Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution matrix
X.
The effective rank of A is determined by treating as zero those
singular values which are less than RCOND times the largest singular
value.
Arguments:
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the matrix A. M >= 0.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix A. N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
         of the matrices B and X. NRHS >= 0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
         On exit, the first min(m,n) rows of A are overwritten with
         its right singular vectors, stored rowwise.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
         On exit, B is overwritten by the N-by-NRHS solution
         matrix X.  If m >= n and RANK = n, the residual
         sum-of-squares for the solution in the i-th column is given
         by the sum of squares of elements n+1:m in that column.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,max(M,N)).
\param[out] S
         S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N))
         The singular values of A in decreasing order.
         The condition number of A in the 2-norm = S(1)/S(min(m,n)).
\param[in] RCOND
         RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
         RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A.
         Singular values S(i) <= RCOND*S(1) are treated as zero.
         If RCOND < 0, machine precision is used instead.
\param[out] RANK
         RANK is INTEGER
         The effective rank of A, i.e., the number of singular values
         which are greater than RCOND*S(1).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= 1, and also:
         LWORK >= 3*min(M,N) + max( 2*min(M,N), max(M,N), NRHS )
         For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         > 0:  the algorithm for computing the SVD failed to converge;
               if INFO = i, i off-diagonal elements of an intermediate
               bidiagonal form did not converge to zero.
