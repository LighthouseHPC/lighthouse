The name of each LAPACK routine is a coded specification of its function (within the very tight limits of standard Fortran  -character names).

All driver and computational routines have names of the form XYYZZZ where for some driver routines the th character is blank.

The first letter X indicates the data type as follows:

S       REAL
D       DOUBLE PRECISION
C       COMPLEX
Z       COMPLEX* or DOUBLE COMPLEX
When we wish to refer to an LAPACK routine generically regardless of data type we replace the first letter by ``x''. Thus xGESV refers to any or all of the routines SGESV CGESV DGESV and ZGESV.

The next two letters YY indicate the type of matrix (or of the most significant matrix). Most of these two-letter codes apply to both real and complex matrices; a few apply specifically to one or the other as indicated in Table ..
