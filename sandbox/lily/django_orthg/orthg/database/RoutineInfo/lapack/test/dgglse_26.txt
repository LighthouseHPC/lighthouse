DGGLSE solves the linear equality-constrained least squares (LSE)
problem:
        minimize || c - A*x ||_2   subject to   B*x = d
where A is an M-by-N matrix, B is a P-by-N matrix, c is a given
M-vector, and d is a given P-vector. It is assumed that
P <= N <= M+P, and
         rank(B) = P and  rank( (A) ) = N.
                              ( (B) )
These conditions ensure that the LSE problem has a unique solution,
which is obtained using a generalized RQ factorization of the
matrices (B, A) given by
   B = (0 R)*Q,   A = Z*T*Q.
