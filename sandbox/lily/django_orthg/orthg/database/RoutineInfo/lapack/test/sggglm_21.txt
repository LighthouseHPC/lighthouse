SGGGLM solves a general Gauss-Markov linear model (GLM) problem:
        minimize || y ||_2   subject to   d = A*x + B*y
            x
where A is an N-by-M matrix, B is an N-by-P matrix, and d is a
given N-vector. It is assumed that M <= N <= M+P, and
           rank(A) = M    and    rank( A B ) = N.
Under these assumptions, the constrained equation is always
consistent, and there is a unique solution x and a minimal 2-norm
solution y, which is obtained using a generalized QR factorization
of the matrices (A, B) given by
   A = Q*(R),   B = Q*T*Z.
         (0)
In particular, if matrix B is square nonsingular, then the problem
GLM is equivalent to the following weighted linear least squares
problem
             minimize || inv(B)*(d-A*x) ||_2
                 x
where inv(B) denotes the inverse of B.
