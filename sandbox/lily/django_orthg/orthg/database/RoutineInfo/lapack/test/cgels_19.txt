CGELS solves overdetermined or underdetermined complex linear systems
involving an M-by-N matrix A, or its conjugate-transpose, using a QR
or LQ factorization of A.  It is assumed that A has full rank.
The following options are provided:
1. If TRANS = 'N' and m >= n:  find the least squares solution of
   an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                minimize || B - A*X ||.
2. If TRANS = 'N' and m < n:  find the minimum norm solution of
   an underdetermined system A * X = B.
3. If TRANS = 'C' and m >= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
   an undetermined system A**H * X = B.
4. If TRANS = 'C' and m < n:  find the least squares solution of
   an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                minimize || B - A**H * X ||.
Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
matrix X.
