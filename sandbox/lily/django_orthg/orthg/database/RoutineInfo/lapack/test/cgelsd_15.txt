CGELSD computes the minimum-norm solution to a real linear least
squares problem:
    minimize 2-norm(| b - A*x |)
using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A. A is an M-by-N
matrix which may be rank-deficient.
Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
matrix X.
The problem is solved in three steps:
(1) Reduce the coefficient matrix A to bidiagonal form with
    Householder tranformations, reducing the original problem
    into a "bidiagonal least squares problem" (BLS)
(2) Solve the BLS using a divide and conquer approach.
(3) Apply back all the Householder tranformations to solve
    the original least squares problem.
The effective rank of A is determined by treating as zero those
singular values which are less than RCOND times the largest singular
value.
The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
without guard digits, but we know of none.
