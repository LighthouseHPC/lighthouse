SGELS solves overdetermined or underdetermined real linear systems
involving an M-by-N matrix A, or its transpose, using a QR or LQ
factorization of A.  It is assumed that A has full rank.
The following options are provided: 
1. If TRANS = 'N' and m >= n:  find the least squares solution of
   an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                minimize || B - A*X ||.
2. If TRANS = 'N' and m < n:  find the minimum norm solution of
   an underdetermined system A * X = B.
3. If TRANS = 'T' and m >= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
   an undetermined system A**T * X = B.
4. If TRANS = 'T' and m < n:  find the least squares solution of
   an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                minimize || B - A**T * X ||.
Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be 
handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution 
matrix X.
Arguments:
\param[in] TRANS
         TRANS is CHARACTER*1
         = 'N': the linear system involves A;
         = 'T': the linear system involves A**T. 
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
\param[in] NRHS
         NRHS is INTEGER
         The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of
         columns of the matrices B and X. NRHS >=0.
\param[in,out] A
         A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
         On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
         On exit,
           if M >= N, A is overwritten by details of its QR
                      factorization as returned by SGEQRF;
           if M <  N, A is overwritten by details of its LQ
                      factorization as returned by SGELQF.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
\param[in,out] B
         B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
         On entry, the matrix B of right hand side vectors, stored
         columnwise; B is M-by-NRHS if TRANS = 'N', or N-by-NRHS
         if TRANS = 'T'.  
         On exit, if INFO = 0, B is overwritten by the solution
         vectors, stored columnwise:
         if TRANS = 'N' and m >= n, rows 1 to n of B contain the least
         squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares for the
         solution in each column is given by the sum of squares of
         elements N+1 to M in that column;
         if TRANS = 'N' and m < n, rows 1 to N of B contain the
         minimum norm solution vectors;
         if TRANS = 'T' and m >= n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
         minimum norm solution vectors;
         if TRANS = 'T' and m < n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
         least squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares
         for the solution in each column is given by the sum of
         squares of elements M+1 to N in that column.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= MAX(1,M,N).
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK.
         LWORK >= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS ) ).
         For optimal performance,
         LWORK >= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS )*NB ).
         where MN = min(M,N) and NB is the optimum block size.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
         > 0:  if INFO =  i, the i-th diagonal element of the
               triangular factor of A is zero, so that A does not have
               full rank; the least squares solution could not be
               computed.
