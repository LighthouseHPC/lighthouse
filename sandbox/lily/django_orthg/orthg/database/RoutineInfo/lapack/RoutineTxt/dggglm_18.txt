DGGGLM solves a general Gauss-Markov linear model (GLM) problem:
        minimize || y ||_2   subject to   d = A*x + B*y
            x
where A is an N-by-M matrix, B is an N-by-P matrix, and d is a
given N-vector. It is assumed that M <= N <= M+P, and
           rank(A) = M    and    rank( A B ) = N.
Under these assumptions, the constrained equation is always
consistent, and there is a unique solution x and a minimal 2-norm
solution y, which is obtained using a generalized QR factorization
of the matrices (A, B) given by
   A = Q*(R),   B = Q*T*Z.
         (0)
In particular, if matrix B is square nonsingular, then the problem
GLM is equivalent to the following weighted linear least squares
problem
             minimize || inv(B)*(d-A*x) ||_2
                 x
where inv(B) denotes the inverse of B.
Arguments:
\param[in] N
         N is INTEGER
         The number of rows of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
\param[in] M
         M is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix A.  0 <= M <= N.
\param[in] P
         P is INTEGER
         The number of columns of the matrix B.  P >= N-M.
\param[in,out] A
         A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,M)
         On entry, the N-by-M matrix A.
         On exit, the upper triangular part of the array A contains
         the M-by-M upper triangular matrix R.
\param[in] LDA
         LDA is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] B
         B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,P)
         On entry, the N-by-P matrix B.
         On exit, if N <= P, the upper triangle of the subarray
         B(1:N,P-N+1:P) contains the N-by-N upper triangular matrix T;
         if N > P, the elements on and above the (N-P)th subdiagonal
         contain the N-by-P upper trapezoidal matrix T.
\param[in] LDB
         LDB is INTEGER
         The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,N).
\param[in,out] D
         D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         On entry, D is the left hand side of the GLM equation.
         On exit, D is destroyed.
\param[out] X
         X is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (M)
\param[out] Y
         Y is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (P)
         On exit, X and Y are the solutions of the GLM problem.
\param[out] WORK
         WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
         On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
\param[in] LWORK
         LWORK is INTEGER
         The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,N+M+P).
         For optimum performance, LWORK >= M+min(N,P)+max(N,P)*NB,
         where NB is an upper bound for the optimal blocksizes for
         DGEQRF, SGERQF, DORMQR and SORMRQ.
         If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
         only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
         this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
         message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
\param[out] INFO
         INFO is INTEGER
         = 0:  successful exit.
         < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
         = 1:  the upper triangular factor R associated with A in the
               generalized QR factorization of the pair (A, B) is
               singular, so that rank(A) < M; the least squares
               solution could not be computed.
         = 2:  the bottom (N-M) by (N-M) part of the upper trapezoidal
               factor T associated with B in the generalized QR
               factorization of the pair (A, B) is singular, so that
               rank( A B ) < N; the least squares solution could not
               be computed.
