            The linear least squares problem is: 
            <pre>
                    <span lang="latex">\min_{x}\left \| b - Ax \right \| _{2}</span>,
            </pre>
            where <span lang="latex">A</span> an m-by-n matrix and <span lang="latex">b</span> is a given m element vector and <span lang="latex">x</span> is the solution. If <span lang="latex">$m \ge n$</span> and  <span lang="latex">B</span>$\mbox{rank}(A) = n$</span>, the solution to problem is unique, and the problem is also referred to as finding a least squares solution to an overdetermined system of linear equations.        </p>
