            Driver routines are provided for two types of generalized linear least squares problems:
            The first is:
            <pre>
                    <span lang="latex">\min_{x}\left \| c - Ax \right \| _{2} \text{subject to } Bx = d</span>,
            </pre>
            where <span lang="latex">A</span> an m-by-n matrix and <span lang="latex">B</span> is a p-by-n matrix,
            and <span lang="latex">c,d</span>are given unknown vextor and <span lang="latex">x</span> is the solution. This is called a linear equality-constrained least squares problem (LSE). The routine xGGLSE solves this problem using the generalized <span lang="latex">RQ (GRQ)</span> factorization, on the assumptions that B has full row rank p and the matrix.<span lang="latex">\left\binom{A}{B}</span>has full column rank n. Under these assumptions, the problem LSE has a unique solution.
        </p>
        <p>
        The second generalized linear least squares problem is:
            <pre>
                    <span lang="latex">\min_{x}\left \| y \right \| _{2}  \text{subject to } d=Ax+By</span>, 
            </pre>
             where <span lang="latex">A</span> an m-by-n matrix and <span lang="latex">B</span> is a p-by-n matrix and <span lang="latex">d</span>is a given unknown vextor with   <span lang="latex">$m \leq n \leq m+p$<span lang="latex">B</span>.
