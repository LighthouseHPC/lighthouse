# You will need to change the TRILINOS_PATH variable below to point to
# the location of your Trilinos install.  Other variables that you may
# need or want to change:
#
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: "DEBUG" or "RELEASE".
#
# BUILD_SHARED_LIBS: If your build of Trilinos includes shared /
# dynamic libraries, you can save build time by linking against them
# instead of static libraries.  Otherwise, set this to OFF.
#
# CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE: Set to ON if you prefer verbose Make output.
