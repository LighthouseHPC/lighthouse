parallel_data.mat: Contains the instance matrix (each row is an instance and each column is a variable) and the class vector for the parallel case.

sequential_data.mat: Contains the instance matrix (each row is an instance and each column is a variable) and the class vector for the sequential case.

pca_matrix.mat: Contains the instance matrix where each row represents a matrix and each column is a feature of the matrix.
